      "content": "December 31, 2024Ari Haruni Wedbush Securitieshasprojecteda significant uptick in tech stock performance for 2025, estimating a 25% increase driven by multiple converging factors. The firm highlights a decrease in regulatory constraints anticipated under a Trump administration, suggesting that the days of stringent oversight by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Lina Khan are behind us. This shift is expected to create a more favorable environment for Big Tech, particularly with enhanced AI initiatives from the government, which Wedbush describes as setting a “goldilocks foundation” for tech giants like Tesla and others. The core of Wedbush’s bullish outlook for 2025 centers on the ongoing AI Revolution, which they predict will inject over $2 trillion in additional capital expenditure into the tech sector over the next three years. This massive investment is expected to fuel growth across various tech companies, particularly those at the forefront of AI development and application. However, the journey to this growth isn’t expected to be without its challenges. Wedbush foresees “white-knuckle moments” due to concerns over Federal Reserve policies, potential escalations in U.S.-China trade relations concerning tariffs, and debates over the valuations of tech stocks which might be seen as stretched by some market observers. Despite these potential hurdles, these are viewed by Wedbush as opportunities to invest in key tech names, aligning with their investment strategy for the past two years. Wedbush has identified what they consider to be the top 10 tech companies poised to capitalize on the AI Revolution in 2025. Leading this list is Nvidia (NVDA), celebrated for its pivotal role in AI hardware, particularly GPUs that are critical for AI computations. Palantir (PLTR) is recognized for its data analytics capabilities, which are increasingly vital in an AI-driven world. Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) are noted for their comprehensive ecosystems where AI enhances user experiences across devices and services. MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW) are highlighted for their innovations in database management, crucial for handling the vast data sets AI requires. Pegasystems (PEGA) and Salesforce (CRM) round out the list, with their focus on AI-driven customer relationship management and enterprise solutions. This forecast from Wedbush is underpinned by a broader trend in the tech industry where AI is not just an add-on but a fundamental component transforming business operations, product development, and consumer interactions. The integration of AI across these companies’ offerings – from hardware acceleration in Nvidia to enterprise software solutions in Salesforce -illustrates a tech sector increasingly defined by AI’s capabilities and potential. The predicted 25% growth in tech stocks underscores a belief in the enduring impact of AI, alongside a supportive political and economic backdrop, positioning these companies for significant gains in the near term. However, investors are advised to be prepared for volatility, as the road to such growth will likely be marked by both opportunities and risks.

      "content": "Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence. Vanda Researchestimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Nvidia has pulled in $29.8 billion in retail net inflows this year, per Vanda Research's findings, up from $11.4 billion last year. Tesla's retail inflows dropped to $14.7 billion from $48 billion in 2023. Tesla still edged out Nvidia as the top holding in retail investor portfolios, however — representing a 10.58% average portfolio weighting compared to 10.33% for Nvidia. The other four top tickers were more index-based trades levered to popular themes such as AI: Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). 2024 was an eventful year for markets, Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said. For the average retail investor, it was another great year of portfolio performance. Loyalty to tech names paid off. Indeed that tech loyalty did pay off. Vanda Research estimates that the average retail portfolio is up 40.74% this year, the second-highest performance since 2014. Only 2023's 41.94% performance was better over this 10-year time span. On a flow-adjusted basis, Vanda Research noted that this would mark the second time retail investors have beaten the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in back-to-back calendar years and the first time since 2014 that the non-institutional crowd beat the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). Whether the feel-good times for retail investors will continue in 2025 is anyone's guess. But the markets are poised to enter January on a whimper despite potential pro-growth Trump policies as the outlook for Fed policy has becomeincreasingly uncertain. The consensus among Fed officials isnow for two rate cuts next yearafter its December meeting, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such aspossibly inflationary tariffs on China. In a new interview on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly didn't rule out a potential rate hike. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2% and 5%, respectively, in December. The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.4%. Market leader Nvidia is down 1% in December. The stock market in 2025 will likely experience fluctuations, but significant opportunities are seen in individual stock picks, especially in sectors like EVs, AI, healthcare, and quantum computing, MarketGauge chief strategistMichele Schneidertold Yahoo Finance. Tax cuts and deregulation could spur growth, although tariffs and inflation remain risks. But hey, maybe they will garner some retail investor attention.

      "content": "In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks analysts are talking about. Marco Argenti, Chief Information Officer at Goldman Sachs, recently said that in 2025, the world will witness the full potential of AI that has been in development. He used the analogy of a child raised in a library, now ready to step out into the world. “What if they, we make them interact with sensory data, with vision data, with, uh, you know, like basically opening that door of the library and making this child walk into the real world? I think this creation of word models, like they’re called generally in the industry, where you combine multimodal information, that is not only text but is also videos, but is also sensory data. It might be temperature, it might be anything you can perceive around you, could actually unlock the next level of capabilities,” Argenti said, according to CNBC. Despite high hopes, a potential plateau in performance improvements in AI systems, high energy consumption of AI data centers and transparency remain key issues tech companies will continue to grapple with in 2025.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Tom Forte, Maxim Group senior consumer internet analyst, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an expensive stock. When you look at the next couple of years for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), on what looks to be a very slow-developing upgrade cycle, if there is a major upgrade cycle, you’re looking at mid to high single-digit EPS growth. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes for the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. While the company is projected to achieve 9.5% EPS growth this fiscal year and 12.3% growth in the next, much of this growth is already priced in, as the stock trades at nearly 30 times the expected EPS for the fiscal year ending September 2026. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of stocks analysts are talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

      "content": "December 27, 2024Ron Haruni On CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime,”Dan Ives,Wedbush‘s global head of technology research, shared his insights on Apple’s recent performance and its potential path to a $5 trillion market cap, primarily driven by an anticipated AI upgrade cycle. Ives recentlyraisedhis price target for Apple (AAPL) to a Street-High of $325 from $300, maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares, attributing his optimism to recent channel checks indicating a robust holiday season, projecting Apple to sell 240 million iPhones this year. Despite Apple’s stock trading at high multiples compared to its earnings, Ives dismissed concerns about overvaluation. This, combined with what he believes will be an underestimated growth in iPhone sales, could push Apple’s valuation far beyond current expectations. He emphasized thatApple Intelligence, part of the iOS 18.2 update, would catalyze this cycle, with hundreds of new AI-driven apps expected to enhance the iPhone ecosystem. He believes that the integration of AI will not only drive iPhone upgrades but also extend across Apple’s entire product line, including iPads and Macs, marking the beginning of a multi-year AI-driven upgrade super cycle. Ives concluded that the current market cap of Apple, around $3.92 trillion, does not reflect the potential growth from AI monetization. He predicts that as AI penetration in Apple’s ecosystem grows from 15% to 25-30%, the company could feasibly reach a$5 trillion valuationwithin the next 12 to 18 months. His vision is for Apple to lead the consumer AI revolution, countering any skepticism with a firm belief in Apple’s strategic position and future growth trajectory. Thank you for your support!",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations.

      "content": "We recently compiled a list of the10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks. Equity market pricing is never perfect due to supply and demand imbalances, emotional reactions, and errors. Billionaire investor David Elliot Shaw excels at detecting and exploiting these inefficiencies to generate shareholder value. Unlike most hedge fund managers who rely on intuition, Shaw uses sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms for investment decisions. Over the years, he has developed software and hardware to gain an edge in investment opportunities. Born in 1951, David E. After earning a PhD from Stanford in 1980, he foundedD.E. Shaw & Co.in 1988 with six employees and $28 million in capital. The hedge fund has averaged a 12.5% return since inception, with only one down year. Shaw’s firm uses powerful computers and advanced algorithms for quick market responses and risk management, returning over $51 billion to investors. Likewise, it generated a net return of 11.88% between 2001 and 2011. While Shaw’s firm was down by 9% at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, it bounced back to profitability with a 21% return in 2009. READ ALSO:10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David EinhornandBillionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. D.E. Shaw is expanding and launching new funds. In 2023, they raised money for D.E. Shaw Alkali Fund VI, the newest in their Alkali group. By November 2024, they had secured $1 billion for this fund, focusing on corporate debt, structured credit, and synthetic securitizations. Last year, the firm also raised $1.1 billion for two new private investment vehicles: D.E. Shaw Voltaic Fund and D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund. In June 2024, D.E. Shaw announced it was raising its second fund in 16 months to target bank capital deals. They filed a private placement notice for D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund II, but the amount wasn’t disclosed. Bloomberg reported that D.E. Shaw’s largest hedge fund, the D.E. Shaw Composite Fund, gained 9.6% in 2023, outperforming the HFR Global Hedge Fund Index, which was up about 2.5% through December 15. Reuters added that D.E. Shaw’s macro-oriented fund, the Oculus Fund, gained 7.8% in 2023, beating its macroeconomic peers. According to Bloomberg, the Oculus Fund has never had a negative year since it started. Diversification is another vital arsenal that D.E. Shaw & Co. relies on to spread risk and reduce market volatility. The firm is highly diversified with a portfolio value of about $116.49 billion. While technology stocks account for the most significant share in the equity market at 24.6%, the hedge fund also has stakes in Services at 17.5% and the financial sector at 7.7%. In addition to diversifying holdings, Shaw relies on a multi-strategy approach to squeeze optimum value in the market. Billionaire D.E. Shaw suggests investing in resilient companies, even as the US Federal Reserve signals fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Despite three cuts reducing the benchmark rate to 4.25%-4.5%, economic slowdown concerns persist, especially in the labor market. Job growth is mainly in government and health care, while growth in manufacturing, business, and professional services has stagnated. Our Methodology To make the list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, we scanned D.E. Shaw & Co investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on D.E. Shaw & Co stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. It is one of the best-performing stocks in the D. E. Shaw portfolio, going by the 37% year-to-date gain. The strong performance comes from investors rallying behind the company’s innovative product lineup and strong financial performance that affirms underlying growth. Similarly, it is one of the best stocks to buy, according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, given the investments it is making in AI. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is investing in Apple Intelligence, an AI-driven initiative that is expected to bolster the iPhone product line. While iPhone sales have appeared subdued in recent years, the integration of AI features is one factor expected to give people a reason to upgrade, strengthening Apple’s revenue base. Consequently, iPhone shipments are projected to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026. The growth would be propelled by features like upgraded Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. While the hardware business has been a key growth driver over the years, the service segment also affirms Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term prospects. The segment is projected to achieve a double-digit growth rate driven by strong pricing power, expanding adoption and new offerings The introduction of AI services is projected to contribute between $7 and $14 billion in incremental services revenue. Likewise, the expectation is high that Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) gross margin will improve next year owing to cost efficiencies and faster-growing service revenue, allowing the company to generate more shareholder value.

This pushed yields higher and risks pressuring mega-cap stocks. The rally in shares of the magnificent seven, which includes Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) are at risk of stagnating. The 30-year yield is 4.77% while the 10-year T-bill is at 4.59%. This will increase mortgage rates, hurting the demand for homes. Since peaking in August, D.H. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) stocks are well off their 52-week highs. Yields are rising because the Fed changed from a dovish, rate-cutting tone it set in the summer. In December, Fed Chair Powell said that the central bank needs to beware of inflation that U.S. tariffs cause. When the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canadian imports, those countries will retaliate. This increases the price of consumer goods for Americans. The U.S. government is hoping that neither trading partner will counter with similarly sized tariffs. Watch out for the risk of the Santa Claus rally fading quickly to start 2025.

      "content": "In just a few days, we'll turn the page on what's been another phenomenal year for Wall Street. As of the closing bell on Dec. As we prepare to step into a new year, here are five seemingly unstoppable stocks that I'd ring the register on and sell right now. There are certainly reasons for investors to be excited about Palantir's future. Companies that have sustainable moats tend to be worthy of a valuation premium. Additionally, Palantir has successfully shifted to recurring profitability, which demonstrates that its operating model works. Nevertheless, there's cause to believe Palantir's parabolic climb will soon come to an abrupt end. More than $142 million of the company's nearly $391 million in net income through the first nine months of 2024 can be traced interest income earned from its cash. Its shares are valued at 75 times trailing-12-month sales, which iswell abovea level consistent with other market leaders that have previously been in a bubble. Another unstoppable stock that I'd consider cashing in some or all of your chips is AI colossusNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has tacked on close to $3.1 trillion in market value since the start of 2023. Like Palantir, there are well-defined reasons for Nvidia's outperformance. Namely, its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice for businesses overseeing AI-accelerated data centers. No company is particularly close to matching the computing capabilities of Nvidia's chips, which, along with AI-GPU scarcity, has afforded this AI kingpin substantial GPU pricing power. However, history has a flawless track record of putting market leaders of next-big-thing innovations in their place, and I don't anticipate artificial intelligence being the exception. Since the mid-1990s, every game-changing innovation has worked its way through an early stage bubble-bursting event, which signals that investors consistently overestimate the early stage adoption and/or utility of new innovations. If the AI bubble bursts, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia. Competition is also picking up from all angles. On top ofAdvanced Micro Devicesramping output of its Insight MI300X chips and introducing its next-generation MI325X GPU, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing their own AI chips. Even though these chips won't have the computing capabilities of Nvidia's H100 or Blackwell GPUs, they'll be notably cheaper and easily accessible. In short, it could cause Nvidia to lose out on valuable data center space. Insiders are providing a catalyst for investors to ring the register, too. It's been four years since any board member or executive has purchased shares of Nvidia on the open market. Shares of the company are up 86% year-to-date, with almost the entirety of these gains coming since Election Day. There's been some chatter that Trump may consider easing autonomous driving regulations, which may create an easier path for Tesla to launch robotaxis in the years to come. The first issue for Tesla is that it's core profit segment -- EV production -- has taken a big hit to its margin over the last two years. With Tesla undertaking more than a half-dozen sweeping price cuts on its fleet since the start of 2023, it signifies that competition and demand are both problematic. There's no immediate resolution to improve the company's vehicle margin. Tesla's income quality is also a bit suspect. Through the first nine months of 2024, a little over 50% of its pre-tax income has come from unsustainable sources that include regulatory tax credits and interest income on its cash. This isn't what you'd expect from a nearly $1.5 trillion growth company. If these unfulfilled promises were backed out of Tesla's valuation, the company's share price would probably crater. The fourth steadily rising stock that I'd advocate investors sell right now is Wall Street's largest publicly traded company by market cap,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is less than $100 billion away from cresting the $4 trillion valuation mark. Apple's gains in 2024 have primarily been the result of the launch of Apple Intelligence. This is the model that incorporates AI-driven tools into iPhone, Mac, and iPad to help users rapidly process text and generate information. Apple's entrance into the AI space has made it popular in the eyes of investors, once again. My concern with Apple is very simple: It's no longer a growth stock. Although Services revenue, which encompasses its subscription-driven services, has been steadily growing by a double-digit percentage, it only accounts for a quarter of Apple's net sales. Meanwhile, revenue for the company's physical devices, including iPhone, have been flat or trending lower. When Apple was growing its sales by the high single digits or low double digits, investors had a reason to pay a premium for its shares. This isn't the case any longer. Despite Apple's growth engine stalling, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has doubled to north of 42 since the start of calendar year 2023 (Apple's fiscal year usually ends in late September). To make matters worse, the only reason Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has been climbing is because of its aggressive share repurchases. If these buybacks are removed from the equation, it would show just how pedestrian Apple's operating results have been in each of the last two years. Last but certainly not least, I'd ring the register and sell shares of self-proclaimed Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)Treasury Company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). Shares are up 468% on a year-to-date basis and more than 2,100% over the trailing-two-year period. Investors' fascination with MicroStrategy has to do with its ongoing acquisition of Bitcoin. Though exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have made it easier than ever to buy Bitcoin, MicroStrategy is viewed as a liquid proxy to bet big on the largest digital currency in the world by market cap. We've witnessed numerous examples throughout history of leverage scenarios coming back to haunt businesses. With MicroStrategy generating very little operating cash flow from its AI-enterprise analytics software segment, this is a major gamble that history suggests won't pay off. As of Dec. 23, MicroStrategy held 444,262 Bitcoin, or more than 2.1% of the Bitcoin that'll ever be mined. With Bitcoin valued at $98,478, at the time of this writing, it means MicroStrategy's portfolio is worth $43.75 billion. Yet MicroStrategy ended Dec. 24 with an $87.7 billion market cap. If we generously assume the software business is worth $1 billion, investors are assigning a 100% premium to its Bitcoin assets -- i.e., paying close to $197,000 per Bitcoin when they can just buy it on an exchange for $98,478. The nail in the coffin that makes MicroStrategy a stock to sell is a Dec. 23 prospectus that seeks the authority to increase the company's share count by 10 billion to 10.33 billion shares, as well as boost the preferred share count by 1 billion to 1.005 billion shares.

Analysts say that the full ‘Santa Claus Rally’ has never been lower. The 10-year and two-year Treasury notes yielded 4.61% and 4.33%, respectively. The probability of having no change in the interest rates for the upcoming Jan. 31, 2025 decision was at 89.3%, down from 91.4% a week ago, accordingtoCME Group’s FedWatch tool.

But even these six days have been higher by 1.7% on average. Mapping the data from 1950, Detrick summarized that the S&P 500 has had a 20% plus return 22 times and a negative return annual return or 21 times in total.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Phil Panaro from the Boston Consulting Group said while talking to Schwab Network that he believes Nvidia shares could reach $800 by 2030. They had a total of $27 billion over 12 months last year. That means in three months, they exceeded their entire 2023 earnings by $8 billion. I’m not sure there’s a stock in the history of the exchange that has driven that much in revenue, while also achieving 50% margins. If you do the math on that $35 billion a quarter, they’re already on a $140 billion annual clip in terms of revenue. In order to achieve the prediction of $800 by 2030, they need to be at $600 billion in revenue. We’re right on target.” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. NVIDIA’s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA’s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA’s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company’s revenue, which presents added risk.” Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1%, closing higher for the fifth consecutive session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each fell less than 0.1% to snap three-day winning streaks.Stocks roseon Monday and Tuesday ahead of yesterday's Christmas break, a positive start to theSanta Clause rallythat investors hope for, as the U.S. market rebounded fromlast week's downturn. Large-cap technology stocks were mostly lower on Thursday. Apple (AAPL), which isinching closer to becoming the first companyto ever achieve $4 trillion in market value, rose 0.3% to a record closing high, while Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA) all lost ground. Shares of bitcoin-related companies slid as the digital currency slumped. Bitcoin was at $95,600 in recent trading, down from an overnight high of nearly $100,000.Bitcoin has gainedabout 35% since the start of the year amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration and a crypto-friendly Congress will implement measures that benefit the digital currency. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is correlated with expectations about where interest rates are headed, was at 4.59%, after moving as high as 4.64% this morning and trading at its highest levels since May. Gold futures were up 0.7% at around $2,655 an ounce, while crude oil futures were down about 0.5%. Biggest S&P 500 Movers on Thursday Advancers Decliners -Michael Bromberg KULR Technology Shares Soar 40% as Company Buys Bitcoin Shares of KULR Technology Group (KULR) soared Thursday after the energy storage company made its first investment inbitcoin, purchasing about $21 million worth of the digital currency. The company said Thursday that it bought 217.18 bitcoins at an average price of $96,556 per bitcoin. KULR shares jumped 40% to a record closing high of $4.80. The move comes after the company said earlier this month it was launching a Bitcoin Treasury strategy that called for allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to the digital currency. It said this $21 million purchase marks its first toward that strategy, with plans to buy more bitcoin in the future. Bitcoin investors have been rewarded with big returns this year as the cryptocurrency soared torecord highsfollowing the reelection of Donald Trump, who has previously said he wants to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Another company that has benefited from the run-up in bitcoin is Microstrategy (MSTR), the biggest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Its shares have surged nearly 500% since the start of the year. Toyota Shares Surge on Reported Plans to Boost ROE Toyota Motor's (TM) U.S.-listed shares soared Thursday following a report that the carmaker is looking to double its targetreturn on equity (ROE). The Japanese auto giant is planning to raised its ROE to 20%, according to a report by Japan’sNikkei,roughly double what analysts were anticipating for this fiscal year. Bloomberglater reported a spokesperson for the company said Toyota doesn’t have an explicit target or deadline to reach that figure. The news comes just days after the Japanese auto industry was roiled by anannouncementfrom Honda (HMC) and Nissan that the two companies plan to merge. Moody’s analystsapplaudedthe move, arguing that it would be “credit positive” if done properly. However, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn warned in an interview that Nissan could face cost-cutting “carnage” in such an arrangement. TradingView Toyota shares were up more than 8% in mid-afternoon trading Thursday, lifting the stock into positive territory for the year. -Bill McColl Where Analysts Think Bitcoin is Headed in 2025 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has had a strong 2024, climbing past many price milestones—including $100,000—as a confluence of factors drove up investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Investopedia / Photo Illustration by Alice Morgan / Getty Images This year's runup started with demand associated with thespot bitcoin exchange-traded funds(ETFs) that began trading in January, followed bya halvingthat limited supply of new bitcoin and then the hope for crypto-supportive policies after the reelection of Donald Trump, seemingly reinforced by several of his post-election appointments. While the Federal Reserve's latest projections for cutting interest rates next year shook the crypto markets, some of the aforementioned reasons for optimism remain on the table—though if the Fed slows its rate-cutting campaign, experts say, Treasury yields could remain elevated, shifting investors away from bitcoin and other risk assets. Read hereabout why some analysts are still bullish on bitcoin—but warn of volatility ahead. -Kyle Torpey Apple Set for 'Golden Era of Growth,' Analyst Says Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, long an Apple (AAPL)bull, told clients in a note Thursday that the iPhone maker could be headed for a “golden era of growth” in 2025, driven by demand forartificial intelligence (AI). The analysts raised their price target for Apple's stock by $25 to $325 and maintained an outperform rating, anticipating a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI that “is still being underestimated by the Street. That's a lot higher than the average analyst price target compiled by Visible Alpha at about $244. Just over half or nine of the 15 analysts polled hold buy or equivalent ratings for the stock, with four hold and two sell ratings. Apple shares were up slightly in midday trading after hitting a fresh all-time high of just over $260. Wedbush's target boost comes as the firm projects Apple could sell more than 240 million iPhones in fiscal year 2025, “as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold and this will be the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple's history.” TradingView Apple shares have gained over one-third of their value since the start of the year, as the company'smarket capitalizationnears $4 trillion. The stock has outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. (See chart above) Wedbush expects Apple could soon reach that $4 trillion threshold, which would make it the first company in the world to do so. At present, there are only three companies with a market caps over $3 trillion, including Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). While that isn’t presently clear, GameStop (GME) fans are doing a little shopping of their own this morning. Shares of the retailer associated with Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill, who for many is the first person who comes to mind when the company comes up, were rising in early trading Thursday. Does that mean he got something nice? Has something to give? Likes nicely wrapped boxes? Predictably, people are wondering—and watching, with the message at recent count seen some 4 million times, according to X, with thousands of responses, retweets and likes. Shares of the company, meanwhile, are up nearly 80% in 2024, though below prices seen at the top of spikeslargely inspired by Gillearlier this year.

      "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. The stock still notched its latest record close, as shares edged up 0.3% on Thursday to $259. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Apple is closing 2024 on a winning streak after a tough start to the year. It facedstruggling iPhone sales, rising competition in China, andclashes with antitrust regulators at homeandabroad. Early data from the initial rollout of Apple’s iPhone 16 lineupdidn’t do much to bolster Wall Street’s confidence, withinvestment firm Jefferiesissuing a rare downgradeon the stock. Other analysts, Ives included,stayed bullish on the stockas more positive iPhone shipment data engendered confidence in Apple’s artificial intelligence strategy for its consumer devices. Apple’sfourth quarter earnings reportin early November showed the tech giant beating expectations on iPhone sales despite missing estimates overall. Shares began to climb in early November to new highs as Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro lineup and, in mid-December,added ChatGPT and other Apple Intelligence AI featuresfor the iPhone, iPad, and macOS. Apple has outperformed several of its so-called Magnificent Seven peers over the past month. While Apple shares have gained more than 11% during that time frame, Meta (META) rose 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT) climbed 4.4%, and Nvidia (NVDA) popped 1%. Still, macroeconomic uncertainty could create headwinds for Apple. The US Federal Reserve’s projection that it would lowerinterest rates less than expectedin 2025 also caused fears of persistent higher rates andsticky inflation,dampening consumer confidenceheading into the new year.

      "content": "Since Warren Buffett became the CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)in 1965, its stock has delivered a compound annual return of 19.8%. That would have been enough to turn a $1,000 investment into $42.5 million, whereas the same investment in theS&P 500would have grown to just $325,053 over the same period. Buffett's long-term investing strategy is simple. He buys into companies with steady growth, robust profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like stock buyback programs and dividend schemes, which help to compound his returns over time. You won't ever see Buffett chasing the latest stock market trend -- not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). With that said, three of the existing stocks in Berkshire's $296 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are integrating AI into their legacy businesses in very unique ways. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)is the world's largest e-commerce company. It's usingAIin its fulfillment centers to drive efficiency, and it even created an AI shopping assistant called Rufus, which can help customers find the right products. However, most investors are focused on Amazon's cloud computing platform called Amazon Web Services (AWS), because it's trying to dominate the three core layers of AI: Infrastructure: AWS operates data centers fitted withNvidia's industry-leading chips, but it also designed its own chips called Trainium (for AI training) and Inferentia (for AI inference). Large language models (LLMs): Developers can access leading third-party models from companies like Anthropic andMeta Platformson the AWS Bedrock platform to accelerate their AI software projects. Bedrock is also home to a family of LLMs called Titan, which Amazon built in-house. Software: Amazon's new Q virtual assistant is embedded in AWS to help businesses extract valuable insights from their internal data. It can also generate computer code on demand to help developers build software. During the third quarter of 2024, AWS revenue came in at $27.4 billion, which was a 19% increase from the year-ago period. AI revenue within AWS, however, grew by a triple-digit percentage, and Amazon says this business is growing 3 times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle. Berkshire invested in Amazon in 2019, although Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying the stock sooner. However, Berkshire's stake is worth $2.2 billion as of this writing, so the conglomerate can still make a lot of money in the long run if Amazon's AI bets pay off. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO)isn't a company people normally associate with cutting-edge technologies like AI, but it didn't become a global soda giant without a healthy splash of innovation. Last year, it even appointed a head of generative AI to oversee all the ways it uses this new technology. AI is already a big part of Coca-Cola's marketing strategy. It recently launched an interactive campaign called Create Real Magic, which allows customers to input prompts into an AI image generator via its website to produce Christmas-themed digital snow globes. These initiatives help the Coca-Cola brand engage with customers in new and exciting ways. The company also used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000. Going forward, Coca-Cola plans to invest heavily in AI. It recently struck a five-year deal with theMicrosoftAzure cloud platform, where it will spend $1.1 billion tapping into AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion to acquire 400 million shares in Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994. It has never sold a single share, and today, that position is worth a whopping $25 billion. AI definitely wasn't part of Buffett's Coca-Cola investment thesis back then, but the technology could add significant value to his stake from here. Berkshire spent $38 billion acquiring a stake inApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)between 2016 and 2023, and at the start of this year, that position was worth over $170 billion. Talk about an incredible return! However, Berkshire has sold more than half of its Apple shares throughout 2024. Buffett might be concerned about the valuation of the broader stock market, so he's cashing in some of his biggest winners. Apple has experimented with AI for years. It initially powered minor features like autocorrect, the recommendation engine in Apple Music, and even the Siri voice assistant. However, the company recently launched Apple Intelligence (in partnership with OpenAI), which is transformational by comparison. It introduces new writing tools capable of summarizing emails and texts, and it can even proofread or rewrite outgoing content. Apple Intelligence can also generate images and learn what users care about the most in order to prioritize their notifications. Plus, Siri now taps into the knowledge of OpenAI's ChatGPT software, so it's smarter than ever. There are more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers. The continued rollout of new AI features might encourage customers to upgrade to the latest devices, which could also accelerate Apple's revenue and earnings growth in the near term. Apple stock remains Berkshire's largest holding, despite the spirited selling this year. Therefore, Buffett and his team could still benefit significantly if Apple's efforts in AI pay off.

      "content": "During a discussion on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’,Tom Forte, a senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group, shared his perspectives on this surge and his ongoing hold rating on Apple’s stock. Forte attributes the recent run-up in Apple’s stock to an AI-fueled rally, with expectations high that AI enhancements will lead to a major iPhone upgrade cycle. Despite this, he maintains a ‘hold’ rating on the stock due to valuation concerns. Currently trading well above 30 times its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple’s valuation is at or above its peers who are also benefiting from the AI surge. When questioned about his skepticism regarding an immediate upgrade cycle, Forte highlights a timing mismatch between hardware and software releases. The iPhone 16 lineup was introduced in September, but the AI-related software updates are being rolled out incrementally, extending into December for the U.S. and potentially April for Europe. This staggered rollout might lead consumers to wait for the next generation model, the iPhone 17, rather than upgrading immediately, thus potentially delaying or diluting the expected upgrade cycle. Forte has maintained his ‘hold’ rating since Apple’s developers conference where they unveiled their AI strategy, observing the market’s reaction but waiting for clear evidence of how AI will translate into earnings growth for Apple. Despite the stock’s impressive performance since the conference, he remains cautious. Given Apple’s size, he suggests that while such a product might add marginal earnings, perhaps around 10 cents per share, it wouldn’t significantly move the needle, especially when the iPhone still constitutes about half of Apple’s revenue. In essence, while the market celebrates Apple’s AI advancements and the potential for an upgrade cycle, Forte’s analysis suggests a more measured approach, focusing on valuation, the timing and impact of AI integration, and the comparative scale of new product entries against Apple’s massive revenue base. Thank you for your support!",

So it it’s a very risky thing to invest in. It’s probably going to give you more volatile returns next year, and I’d a little bit worry that the AI rally has extended itself. So uh those may be uncomfortably volatile returns.” Hancock said investors should also pay attention to some of the “old economy” stocks. He also urged investors to look for stocks outside the US. Hancock believes AI gains are now set to broaden out to smaller companies that have not received a lot of attention so far.

The firm sees significant potential in the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) market, largely driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The research firm highlighted that companies involved in AI compute, networking, and storage benefited in 2024 due to strong infrastructure development, resulting in notable share price outperformance and positive earnings revisions. Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is one of JP Morgan’s favorite chip stocks for 2025 as it believes the company is “leveraged to AI and accelerated computing.” Marvell Tech Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is rapidly positioning itself as an AI-first company, with its custom silicon business accounting for 73% of Q3 revenues, up from 39% during the same period last year. Marvell has a five-year agreement with Amazon (AMZN) AWS, helping Amazon design its Trainium and Inferentia ASICs, and providing a range of optical interconnect products. Marvell Tech Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is now focusing on the AI opportunity, as evidenced by the recent restructuring charges, and is progressing through the design phase of its 2nm platform. Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Marvell Technology, Inc. We believe Marvell has among the broadest range of intellectual property in technological areas (e.g., high-bandwidth data switching and storage applications) that position it well for the growing requirements of data centers, wireless networks and autos. Several of the company’s product lines (e.g., custom silicon, optical connectivity and switching) are benefiting from the growth of AI data centers. And we believe a significant opportunity exists for the company to help design and manufacture cost-effective custom data center chips that would help cloud providers reduce their reliance on expensive graphics processing units (GPUs). And ultimately, those are AI products. I believe that the market itself is doing a bit of a repricing, but you know, ultimately we’re talking about the future of transportation here. The legacy OEMs are either cutting or removing both their EV and autonomy programs. Again, the energy business is growing 50% a year; it’s still a nascent business. So from our perspective, we’re still in very early innings here, and this is a play that we see compounding out throughout the decade.” Looking beyond the recent spike in Tesla shares amid Donald Trump’s victory, Tesla’s fundamentals are challenged.

Notably absent was the discussion of a “more affordable” model that Musk had previously mentioned to boost confidence in Tesla’s vehicle sales growth outlook. What about the $30,000 price tag claim? With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. In contrast, the average price per passenger seat in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s most affordable long-range RWD Model 3—factoring in full self-driving (FSD) licensing—is under $10,000 ($29,990 post-incentive vehicle price plus $8,000 for the FSD license, divided by four passenger seats). Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime. There is a lot of hype around Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) robo taxis but many believe they will not be enough to fix the company’s long-term challenges. What are these challenges? Meanwhile, competitors are rolling out more advanced models. According to Reuters, Tesla’s market share in Europe is slipping as legacy automakers like BMW post stronger sales. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In short, the market seems to be pricing in a lot of positive optionality for this company in the near-to-intermediate term (and particularly a fully autonomous fleet of electric vehicles in the medium term). What exists today is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment that is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. “You have to be a little careful with these sort of first-party benchmarks, but they believe that they will compete well versus a subset of Nvidia’s parts. But the issue is those parts that they’re competing at with Nvidia are already here, right? Whereas we’re waiting, you know, I don’t know, 6, 9, 12 months for the relevant A and B parts. And if you sort of look on a timeline, the relative dates of introduction of competing parts, Nvidia’s still got their parts in the market at least a year in advance in many cases. So I don’t really see the moat around Nvidia’s parts flagging. So, I mean, it’s growing off of that. But I can clearly see where the dollars are really flowing in the space. It’s not really Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD). It clearly is Nvidia.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) bulls believe the market should stop comparing the company’s chips with Nvidia and focus on its data-center growth and its competitive edge over other players like Intel. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)’s strong growth in the data center segment is indeed impressive, driven by Instinct GPU shipments and strong sales of EPYC CPUs. According to Goldman Sachs Research, global data center demand could surge by 160% by 2030. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022. McKinsey estimates that adding the required U.S. capacity will need over $500 billion in infrastructure investment by the decade’s end. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)’s forward-adjusted PEG ratio is about 40% lower than the median for the tech sector (XLK). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 Nancy Tengler from Laffer Tengler Investments said in a recent program on Schwab Network that Broadcom is the “poor man’s Nvidia” and called the stock one of her best ideas. Tengler said the guidance given by Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO Hock Tan was “unexpected” and “explosive” and his “enthusiasm” drove the stock price. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Investment firm J.P. Morgan recently said that the latest Wave7 Research survey indicates Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 is lagging in market share compared to the previous cycle, potentially due to limited awareness of Apple Intelligence. “Recent surveys from Wave7 Research into US sales trends across various carriers in Oct/Nov-24 highlight that average share for iPhone 16 cycle continues to track lower y/y (relative to share for iPhone 15 in the same period) despite better than seasonal trends in the latest month of survey data,” J.P. “The survey highlights that the lower momentum, reflected in the lower market share y/y, is likely led by the (still) lower consumer awareness for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence, despite expectations for the feature set to be a key driver for an upgrade cycle.” Chatterjee maintains an Overweight rating on Apple shares. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. In the latest earnings call, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook highlighted new features for the iPhone, such as a more comfortable watch band and sleep apnea detection, but none appeared to be major demand drivers for new customers. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” HeadlineNASDAQ:ADINASDAQ:AMDNASDAQ:AAPLNASDAQ:NVDANASDAQ:METANASDAQ:GOOGNASDAQ:AVGONASDAQ:AMZNDaily NewsletterApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)Tesla Inc.

      "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at:Wall Street Analysts Can’t Stop Talking About These 10 AI Stocks. Henry Ajder, Latent Space Advisory founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that lack of fresh data remains a key challenge for the performance of AI systems after a period of “huge” developments and fast learning. We have a finite amount of data available on the internet and a limited number of sources for live, fresh data. I believe this is becoming an increasingly significant challenge, especially as legal issues surrounding how companies obtain and use data are becoming more prominent,” the analyst said. Ajder believes there won’t be a complete “halt” to the progress in AI systems but in 2025 we are expected to see a slowdown. Answering a question about the AI’s ability to make up data, called synthetic data” to train itself, the analyst said this domain has shown promise but there are risks of synthetic data potentially corrupting the training models. READ ALSO7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending based on latest news. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). I mean, they’re just a category killer. I don’t own any Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR), and neither do my clients. But let me tell you, if that price came down, I would be a buyer.” What makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. My analyst, Jesus, and I went out to go see Iron Maiden in San Diego. We had to rent a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to check it out. Everything about that car, I hate. Every general manager, some of them are clients that run auto dealerships, you can make a lot of money doing auto dealerships, let me tell you, they all say the same thing: People are coming in and saying, “Is it morally okay if I switch back to gas?” Because people don’t want electric cars, they want a Tesla. It’s an old design. It’s up 50% since the election. I’m sorry, Elon Musk is going to make bank hanging out being a bro with Trump on SpaceX. So I’m not in it.” Looking beyond the recent spike in Tesla shares amid Donald Trump’s victory, Tesla’s fundamentals are challenged. How? Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) key robotaxi event was short on details. Notably absent was the discussion of a “more affordable” model that Musk had previously mentioned to boost confidence in Tesla’s vehicle sales growth outlook. What about the $30,000 price tag claim? With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. In contrast, the average price per passenger seat in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s most affordable long-range RWD Model 3—factoring in full self-driving (FSD) licensing—is under $10,000 ($29,990 post-incentive vehicle price plus $8,000 for the FSD license, divided by four passenger seats). Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime. There is a lot of hype around Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) robo taxis but many believe they will not be enough to fix the company’s long-term challenges. What are these challenges? According to Reuters, Tesla’s market share in Europe is slipping as legacy automakers like BMW post stronger sales. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In short, the market seems to be pricing in a lot of positive optionality for this company in the near-to-intermediate term (and particularly a fully autonomous fleet of electric vehicles in the medium term). What exists today is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment that is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. We continue to question the company’s long-term growth profile and governance.” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 116 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has been upgraded to “Overweight” from “Sector Weight” by KeyBanc. They believe Salesforce’s new AI tool, Agentforce, is a big deal for business software. KeyBanc analysts are enthusiastic about Agentforce’s potential. We are fans of this agentic wave in artificial intelligence compared to its copilot predecessor and believe there is real potential for Agentforce to pull activity across Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Clouds into its demand orbit.” KeyBanc has set a $440 price target for Salesforce stock. We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI. Salesforce is seeing slower revenue growth than we would have expected, given the weakening macroeconomic environment. They reported $12.2 billion for the year, which translates to roughly $37 billion for the quarter. The guidance was around $35 billion, so the AI performance for the quarter exceeded expectations. Even though the revenue outlook for fiscal Q1 is roughly in line with expectations, investors were worried about things like wireless seasonality into Q1 and some potential lumpiness in AI. We’ll get more details on the segments during the call, but as of right now, the inline revenue seems to be in line with where investors expected it to be going into the quarter, which is likely why the stock is up.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates.

And every product, you know, people go, ‘Oh my God, Vision Pro is going to be terrific,’ and then you figure out, no, nobody’s going to wear ski goggles on their head. Then you look at what’s going on with the iPhone and the features they’ve rolled out, which surprised me because they weren’t particularly good to start with. They’re going to get upgraded in December in the US, but then you have to wait for next year for it to be upgraded in the rest of the world. And you’ve got a company that’s also trading at a 33 P/E for 5% revenue growth over the past three years combined. So that’s the other one where if people finally go, ‘You know what? The problem isn’t this. It’s market share losses to people like Huawei that have resurged in China.’” Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. “We think they are a very strong player and maybe a dominant player in the infrastructure space. But, you know, I have to mention that they had a pretty good earnings report this past quarter. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Broadcom Inc.

      "content": "The automotive industry is shaking up as it tries to catch up with Tesla’s (TSLA) lead in electric vehicles. Honda (HMC) jumped by 12.72% to start this week’s trade after announcing merger talks with Nissan (NSANY). NSANY stock already last week on Dec. 17 in anticipation of the news. The merger would create the third-largest automaker as measured by sales. The two firms would be behind Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF). Be wary of HMC stock from here. The deal creates operational headwinds. Toyota will widen its lead in hybrid vehicles while Tesla continues to dominate the EV market. Apple (AAPL) closed at a fresh all-time high on Monday. At 3.931 trillion dollars in market cap, the $4 trillion level is next. While the rise is inevitable, AAPL stock risks pulling back. The firm’s iPhone does not offer compelling features that would ignite an upgrade supercycle among its customers. Energy stocks are in a downward trend that is due to end. Wait for WTI crude prices to stabilize. When it does, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has the best risk-reward profile. The stock trades at a 13.11 times P/E multiple. Exxon Mobil (XOM) could also rebound after it fell from $122 last month to close recently at around $106.00.",

Warren Buffettis entering 2025 with the largest cash reserve atBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) in over three decades. What Happened: The conglomerate’s cash holdings have reached a staggering $325 billion, marking the highest percentage of total assets since 1990, CNBCreportedon Tuesday. This cash accumulation comes as Buffett, 94, finds few attractive investment opportunities amid a highly valued market. The “Buffett indicator,” which compares the total market value of U.S. stocks to GDP, has soared to 209%, a level not seen since the 1929 market peak, according to Oppenheimer data. Throughout 2024, Buffett sold significant portions of his largest holdings, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andBank of America Corp.(NYSE:BAC), offloading $133 billion in stocks during the year’s first three quarters. Despite this, Berkshire’s shares rose 27% in 2024, its best performance since 2021. See Also:Smith & Wesson’s Fate Hangs In The Balance As Supreme Court Weighs Mexico’s Gun Trafficking Lawsuit: SWBI Stock Down 27% Over Past Month, Here’s What’s Next Buffett’s strategy may involve waiting for a major acquisition opportunity, potentially benefiting his successor,Greg Abel. AnalystKevin Healfrom Argus Research suggests that some of the cash could be used for investments in distressed situations, allowing successors to leave their mark. This will also provide an opportunity for the successors to make their own mark when Mr. Buffett ocially hands over the reins. Why It Matters: This substantial cash reserve positions Berkshire Hathaway for strategic maneuvers in the coming years. Recently, Buffett’s investment activities have shown a shift. In December, Berkshire significantly increased its stake inOccidental Petroleum Corp.(NYSE:OXY), acquiring approximately 8.9 million shares over a few days. This move, totaling around $405 million, raised Berkshire’s ownership to 28% of Occidental, valued at approximately $12 billion. Image via Shutterstock © 2026 Benzinga.com.

      "content": "US stocks finished Monday's session higher despite a batch of mixed economic data, with the Dow rising for the third straight day as indices continue their attempted recovery from last week's sell-off. Nevertheless, Wall Street trading was expected to be somewhat muted this week, with the NYSE shutting up shop early on Tuesday for the festive break and not opening again until Thursday. The Dow gained 0.2% to 42,096.65, inching higher for the third consecutive session following a 10-day losing streak which saw the index drop 6% of its value. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose for the second straight day, gaining 0.8% and 1.0% respectively. Economic data in focus Economic data was mixed on Monday, starting with US durable-goods orders which fell for the third time in four months. Orders were down 1.1% in November, after a 0.8% gain in October, worse than the 0.4% decline expected by the market. Elsewhere, consumer sentiment in the US unexpectedly declined in December, pulling back after strong gains over the previous two months as concerns about the future outlook returned. The Conference Board's closely followed consumer confidence index fell to 104.7 this month from 112.8 in November, surprising analysts who had forecast a small improvement to 112.9. Meanwhile, new home sales rose by 5.9% to 664,000 in November, slightly ahead of the 650,000 consensus estimate, but only partially rebounding after the revised 14.8% slump registered the month before.

Fed chair Powell dropped a big lump of coal in the market’s stocking last week as he reigned in the Fed’s rate cut projections for 2025. While the Fed cut its key benchmark rate by the expected 25 basis points, Powell tempered expectations on future rate cuts based on sticky inflation data and the continued robust spending from American consumers. The Fed's so-called ‘dot plot,' which anticipates the frequency and strength of future rate activity, now indicates only two rate cuts in 2025, with a Fed funds rate at 3.75% – 4.00% by the end of next December. Nasdaq led the losers, with the tech-heavy index dropping more than 3.5%. After hours, AI-darling Micron Technology added to the pain with a significant earnings miss, and the stock had itsworst performance since March 2020the following day. Add in a close-call government shutdown and low holiday trading volume, and it was the perfect storm for some year-end volatility. And it won’t stop there. A cautious Fed means cautious investors and a change in strategy is necessary for 2025. Is this the end of the AI-infused tech rally? The prospects of rate reductions slashing capital costs and juicing stock prices have diminished, and AI stocks are beginning to see some cracks form. While AI isn't exiting the investment landscape anytime soon, the big winners over the last two years look to be finally taking a breather. In their place, we've identified five tech stocks not dependent on AI that could lead the way in 2025. GOOG revenue and earnings have increased every quarter since March 2023, and profit margins are finally back above 27% for the first time since March 2022. The stock slumped in the summer following a poor earnings report and again in November on (you guessed it)antitrust concerns, but it’s currently back near all-time highs. It's been a tumultuous year for Uber. The company finally posted a positive annual net income figure in 2023, and the stock rallied from $25 to $80 between December 2022 and February 2024. But the rally stalled there, and the stock bounced between $60 and $80 for most of the last nine months. [End-of-Year Sale: Unlock Benzinga Pro for 60% Off] CACI provides technology solutions as a defense contractor, and it could see tailwinds in the coming months due to an increased focus on defense spending in the incoming Trump administration and its sterling business reputation. CACI International provides cybersecurity, cyberspace and digital solutions for domestic and international clients. The RSI reading of 27 indicates an oversold stock, and the company has good fundamentals with a 19.9 P/E ratio and a consensus Buy rating from analysts. Sometimes, you don't need to overthink it. Apple has been one of the biggest winners in the tech sector since Trump's election, and the company's cash pile is the envy of the business world. Despite already being one of the largest companies in the world by market cap, investors may have an opportunity here as the AI rally spins down. AAPL is a staple in any long-term investment portfolio, but the time is ripe to add more shares. The stock has been roaring upward since May 2024 and made another new all-time high as the third week of December came to a close. AAPL is now approaching a $4 trillion market cap, and its rally could continue in 2025 if the company is granted tariff exemptions similar to the ones it received during the first Trump administration.

Google's recent quantum computing breakthrough unveiled a chip capable of speeds beyondany in the known universe, which could become an investment theme in 2025 (more on that later). The companyrecently announceda new service in Tokyo, its first international city, and recent testing data continues to show impressivesafety statistics. Alphabet is also the parent of YouTube, which is the dominant way people consume podcasts and short-length videos and its YouTubeTV streaming service has an impressive sports package (and little pushback to price increases). We think this recent drawdown is overdone, and the stock could be poised for a rally in 2025. Despite the proliferation of Waymo, Uber is still the dominant force in rideshare, and its ride-hailing market share is actually expanding compared to its biggest rival, Lyft. From a technical standpoint, the stock is oversold according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 50-day moving average is still hovering above the 200-day MA. As mentioned above, if AI takes a breather over the next few months, one investment theme that could emerge is quantum computing. Quantum computing stocks have rallied hard in the last month, led by the aptly named Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT). used to be known as Innovative Beverage Group, which raises some questions about its dedication to the industry. There may be better choices to take advantage of this trend, like Rigetti Computing Inc.",

      "content": "The investing landscape is littered with combinations, such as large-cap growth or small-cap value. Some are official, while others are not. Officiality aside, some combinations work well together, indicating they’re the peanut butter and jelly of the investing world. One example is the marriage of the quality factor and wide moat stocks. It’s not official, but it is real, as proven by theInvesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). SPHQ, which tracks the S&P 500®Quality Index, beat the S&P 500 by 300 basis points for three years ending December 18. Add to that, the Invesco exchange traded fund was slightly less volatile on an annualized basis than the parent gauge over that period. Alone, those points confirm that an emphasis on quality, when properly deployed, can benefit investors. However, it should not be ignored that SPHQ’s roster is chock full of stocks with wide moat credentials. SPHQ’s aforementioned three-year performance was accrued with below market allocations to the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. Said another way, SPHQ currently doesn’t featureAlphabet (GOOG),Amazon (AMZN)orMeta Platforms (META)among its holdings. However, the ETF’s 34.36% weight to tech stocks, which is about 200 basis points in excess of the S&P 500’s weight to that sector, helps its wide moat credentials. “The quality score favors stable, profitable companies to those that mortgage their balance sheets for rapid growth. He didn’t mention specific SPHQ holdings that qualify as wide moat names, but it’s not a stretch to assume that among the ETF’s tech components,Apple (AAPL)andMicrosoft (MSFT)are among those with wide moat chops. That duo combines for 11% of the SPHQ roster. Mastercard (MA)andVisa (V)also combine for 11% of SPHQ’s portfolio and are the ETF’s two largest financial services holdings. The same is true of several of the fund’s consumer staples holdings. SPHQ’s various “holdings have flexed the merits of their moats.

      "content": "Stock Will Join Nasdaq 100 Index on Monday Mrinalini Krishna is a former Senior Editor of investing news at Investopedia. She's been a journalist for more than 10 years covering business, personal finance, and investing news. Investopedia / Photo composite by Alice Morgan / Getty Images MicroStrategy (MSTR) was an obscure software company until it started making a massive bet on bitcoin (BTCUSD). Shares of the company have gained more than 400% since the start of 2024, as bitcoin has surged to record highs above $100,000 amid optimism that the digital currency will benefit from policies that the incoming Trump administration and a crypto-supportive Congress are likely to put in place. MicroStrategy, little known to most investors before this year's rally, is now stepping further into the spotlight as itjoins the Nasdaq 100 Index, which comprises many of the largest, most actively traded companies in the world, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). As a result, exchange-traded funds that track the index, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), have to adjust their portfolios to include MicroStrategy. However, some investors have said the blockbuster stock price gains aren't sustainable, in part because of the leverage. MicroStrategy shares have generally mirrored bitcoin's directional moves as the company has built its stake in the cryptocurrency. The strategy of using leverage, however, has translated into stock price gains that have far outpaced bitcoin, which is up about 125% since the start of the year. The company, which hasn't turned a profit in any quarter this year, purchased its first batch of bitcoin in 2020, when it was trading close to $11,000. The company has purchased the cryptocurrency 45 times since 2020 for a total of 444,262 BTC on its books.That’s more than 2% of the21 million bitcointhat will ever exist, making MicroStrategy the second-largest corporate holder of the asset behind BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The company measures its bitcoin investment success using a metric called bitcoin yield, loosely translated to how its ownership of bitcoin has changed per outstanding share of the company. At the end of last year MicroStrategy held 189,150 bitcoins and its assumed diluted shares outstanding figure was 207,636, making the ratio 0.91. As of Dec. 23, with the company's bitcoin holdings soaring to 444,262 BTC and its outstanding shares at 280,828 the ratio was 1.576. The year-over-year percentage change between the two ratios, or the bitcoin yield, therefore stood at 73.1%. MicroStrategy said in a regulatory filing this month that the yield can be used to supplement an investor’s understanding of the Company’s decision to fund the purchase of bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock or instruments convertible to common stock. The company issues equity orzero-coupon debtbacked by a small amount of its existing bitcoin reserves in order to buy larger quantities of bitcoin using simplearbitrage. When we do it with debt, we issue $3 billion of debt that's backed by $600 million of bitcoin, it comes due in five years, we pay 0% interest. But then over the course of the five years, we double or quadruple the investment, because we're buying an asset which is appreciating faster than the S&P, Saylor told CNBC. According to analysts at Bernstein, “MicroStrategy presents a leveraged play on Bitcoin.”Bernstein recently raised its price target on the stock to $600, from $290 previously. The stock is currently trading around $360. Also, even if MicroStrategy has to issue shares to meet the convertible debt obligations, those will have a limited effect in diluting the company's equity, according to Benstein. Not everyone is convinced MicroStrategy's performance is sustainable. “Much respect to @saylor, but even he must know $MSTR is overheated,” said short seller Citron Research in an X post in November, adding that the company’s trading volumes are “completely detached” from bitcoin fundamentals. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz toldCNBCrecently that because of leverage he expects a sharper correction in bitcoin-related stocks such as MicroStrategy than in the cryptocurrency itself.

      "content": "In a year marked by record highs in markets and further uncertainty, here are some of the stocks that have reflected key trends and been closely monitored by investors. Strong earnings, particularly out of the major US technology companies, have helped drive market movements this year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) hit the6,000 points markin November on the back of Donald Trump's US election win. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also recently topped20,000 for the first time. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio In addition to record earnings, central banks started to cut interest rates as inflation cooled, which has further fuelled market momentum. However, there have been elements of instability, with conflict in the Middle East and the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine war. Investors have also had to contend with the uncertainty of election outcomes globally, with much focus on the US election and what could be on the cards once Trump returns to the White House in January. Before turning to the coming year, here's a look at the global stocks that made headlines. In the UK, Lloyds Banking Group has long been a popular stock with investors, partly because it has offered a solid rate of income for portfolios. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 5.11%, according to Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L). This is a measure of return and refers to the ratio of dividend that is paid out to investors as a proportion of the share price. Lloyds announced an interim dividend of 1.06p a share in itshalf-year results in July, up 15% on the previous year. In November, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) bank said that it had completed its £2bn ($2.5bn) share buyback programme, which is whencompanies repurchase their own sharesand return the funds to investors. Read more:European bank stock picks for 2025, according to Deutsche Bank Robust financial results had helped drive Lloyds shares higher for most of the year, with the bankbeating expectations in the latest third quarterand reiterating its full-year guidance. It is feared that the landmark ruling has paved the way for a multi-billion-pound redress scheme. Lloyds owns the UK's biggest motor finance provider Black Horse. The bank's CEO, Charlie Nunn, has warned that the UK's consumer finance sector is facing an investability problem in the wake of the ruling. Deutsche Bank analyst Robert Noble said in a note published on 11 November he was keeping a buy rating on the stock. The court's ruling has opened up the possibility of 'full rescission', he said. Lloyds' substantial capital generation could swallow even this extremely unlikely event. Another stock on the list that investors like for its income is UK telecoms company BT, with a dividend yield of 5.47%, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. BT announced an interim dividend of 2.4p per share in itshalf-year results, released in November, which was slightly higher than the payout of 2.31p it delivered for the same period last year. That increase in dividend came despite the fact that BT posted a 3% dip in revenue to £10.1bn in the first six months of its fiscal year and an 11% fall in profit after tax to £755m. Read more:Stocks that are trending today BT reiterated its full-year guidance on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation but revised its revenue estimates for the year to down 1% to 2%. It said this primarily reflected weaker non-UK trading including reduced low-margin kit sales, along with a softer environment in the corporate and public sector . Shares are up 18% year-to-date, though Barclays' equity research team said in a note on 10 December that they foresaw rising revenue headwinds for the company in 2025 and 2026, and downgraded their rating on the stock from overweight to equal weight . FTSE 100-listed supermarket Tesco has maintained its lead as the UK's largest grocer, withKantar datashowing its market share grew to 28.1% in the 12 weeks to the beginning of December. Shares are up 26% year-to-date, with the supermarket havingupgraded its guidancefor the year on the back of strong half-year results in October. Tesco said group sales were up 3.5% in the first half to £31.5bn, compared to the same period last year, and adjusted operating profits had risen nearly 16% to £1.7bn. As a result, it guided to adjusted operating profits for the year of around £2.9bn, up from at least £2.8bn in its previous estimate.

That said, the supermarket had seen greater demand for its Finest premium products, with volumes up nearly 15% year-on-year and over 20 million customers shopping the range in the first half of its fiscal year. In April, Tesco announced plans to buy back £1bn of shares in the following 12 months, and in the half-year results said that £2.4bn had been purchased since the launch of its capital return programme in October 2021. The oil major announced a share buyback of $1.75bn (£1.39bn) in itsthird quarter results. This was part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that was still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105. BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years in its results in October. The oil major's underlying replacement cost profit, which is its metric used as a version of net income, had fallen 30% in the third quarter to $2.3bn. Read more:What are share buybacks? That net income figure was the lowest since thefourth quarter of 2020during the height of the pandemic, when BP posted an underlying replacement cost profit of $115m. In a note on 10 December, Barclays kept an overweight rating on the stock. Going forward, this has to change. BP needs to be simpler and more focused in order to deliver higher value. Much of the market buzz this year has been around chipmaker Nvidia, considered to be a major beneficiary of investment globally in AI, as an enabler of this trend. The stock is up 164% year-to-date, having overtaken iPhone-maker Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company at one point. However, it has since slipped back to second place with a market capitalisation of $3.2tn. Investors have developed high expectations around Nvidia's results, with even slight misses in certain areas denting share price performance. The stock fell after the release of the company's third quarter results, as even though key metrics topped expectations, investors appeared disappointed by a decline gross margins and the company's guidance on revenue, fuelling concerns over slowing growth. Read more:Global chip stocks to consider as investments beyond Nvidia Nvidia posted revenue of $35.1bn for the third quarter, which was well ahead of analysts estimates of $33.2bn. Earnings per share came in at $0.81, compared with expectations of $0.74. Despite recent nervousness, many investors have remained bullish on the stock. For example, investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) had a overweight rating on the stock in its note on 21 November, saying it remained analysts' top pick in the semiconductor space and upped their price target on the stock from $160 to $168 per share. Morgan Stanley's analysts said that while constraints around its AI Blackwell chip are likely to be a major factor for at least a year ... we continue to see a strong Blackwell cycle as a driver for the stock for several quarters. A major catalyst in driving Tesla shares to fresh record highs over the past month has been Donald Trump's US election win. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a big supporter of Trump's campaign and has beenappointed to co-leadthe extra-governmental Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors believe that Trump's return to the White House could offer a more supportive policy environment for Tesla. Shares in Tesla are up 76% year-to-date and even with some concerns around thelack of detailoffered at the electric carmaker's robotaxi event in October, investors have remained bullish on the stock. Read more:FTSE 100 best performing stocks of 2024 In a note released on 10 December, Morgan Stanley analysts reiterated their overweight rating as their top pick out of the US automakers and raised the price target on the stock from $310 to $400. Elon Musk's entry into the political sphere has expanded investor thinking around Tesla’s fundamental outlook, they said. They added that Musk's emergence from a political ‘outsider’ to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla’s journey beyond autos. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives hasraised his price target on the stockeven higher, to $515 per share. In addition to the potentially supportive environment under Trump, Ives said he was also optimistic about Tesla's progress on full self-driving technology. For Danish pharmaceuticals firm Novo Nordisk, the story around the company over the past few years has been the growing popularity of its weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. The Copenhagen-listed drugmaker is Europe's largest listed company, with a market capitalisation of 2.56 trillion Danish krone (£284bn). Read more:Funds for investors to watch in 2025 However, over the past few months shares have slumped, leaving it 12% in the red year-to-date. In its third quarter results, Novo Nordisk saidsales of Wegovy were up 79% year-on-year. However, the drugmaker narrowed its full-year sales growth guidance to between 23% and 27%. Even so, investors have remained optimistic about the company, with Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis keeping a buy rating on the stock, according to a note released on 10 December. That's why its warning of a slower recovery in the semiconductor market and lowered sales guidance in its third quarter results triggered asell-off in the sectorin October. Read more:Major companies that are also popular short-selling stocks Despite this, analysts have maintained strong ratings on the stock. In a Barclays (BARC.L) note on 18 November, the bank's equity research team kept an overweight rating on ASML. They said that the company's recent capital markets day, which is a day for investors, was largely reassuring . Turning to India, the most valuable listed company in country is conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELIANCE.NS), with a market capitalisation of 17.16 trillion Indian rupees (£158bn). Reliance – which is run by Asia's wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani – spans across a number of sectors, including energy, retail and media. In recent developments for the business, Reliance and Disney (DIS) announced last month that they that they hadcompleted the $8.5bn mergerof their Indian media assets, to make the company Jio Star. Read more:FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays The merged group, which will be India's largest entertainment company, will be split into three divisions: entertainment, digital and sports. As for performance, Reliance posted consolidated revenues of $30.8bn in the second quarter, which was only marginally higher than the same period last year. Meanwhile, the business saw a small decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to $5.2bn. While the stock logged strong growth in the first half of the year, shares have lagged since, leaving them 1% in the red year-to-date. India's second biggest company by market capitalisation is Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is the IT company that sits under conglomerate Tata Group. The group's companies were in focus in October after it announced that its former chairman Ratan Tata had passed away at the age of 86. The business tycoon led Tata Group, one of India's largest companies, for more than 20 years. In his time as chairman, the group made key acquisitions, including the purchase of British tea brand Tetley, as well as buying car brands British Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co (F).

In October, TCS also launched an Nvidia business unit to accelerate AI adoption for its customers across different industries. In terms of company performance, TCS postedlower-than-expected profits in its second quarter, which led to a fall in its share price. However, TCS shares hit an all-time high in August and rebounded since falling on the back of October's results, leaving the stock 10% in the green year-to-date. A bellweather for the global semiconductor industry is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which is the world's largest contract chipmaker, manufacturing the designs of the likes of Nvidia. When it released its latest results last month, which were better-than-expected, chip stocks rallied. TSMC's Taiwan-listed shares are up 75% year-to-date. In the third quarter, TSMC's revenue in US dollars was up 36% year-on-year to $23.5bn and in the fourth quarter, the company said it expected revenue to come in between $26.1bn and $26.9bn. “Bottom line, we saw not only the huge beat and then the raise [but also] the discussion even into next year,” he said, which indicated demand strength that is expected to continue being strong. “Clearly, I think the people are having a hard time accepting it, but look, this AI thing is real, he added. The demand is real. It's continuing. And there's a lot of opportunity moving forward.” The slowdown in China's economy, which has seen consumers cut down on spending, has been a headwind for retailers heavily exposed to the country. Data showed that China'sretail sales rose by 3%in November, which was the slowest pace in three months. However, officials havesignalled bigger fiscal spendingto come in 2025, in an effort to boost consumption. The slump in spending has put pressure on the likes of e-commerce giant Alibaba, whichmissed against analyst expectations for salesin the second quarter. Read more:UK house prices rise by £10,000 in one year However, Alibaba's adjusted profit of 15.06 yuan per American depository share, came in ahead of estimates of 14.88 yuan. Jefferies (JEF) had a buy rating on the stock, as of a note on 17 November, following the release of the company's latest results. The investment bank's equity analysts Thomas Chong and Zoey Zong said: Alibaba has multiple growth drivers in the years ahead, in our view, with its core marketplace a strong cash cow that enjoys secular growth momentum amid consumption upgrade in China, thanks to solid execution and technological strength in digitalizing the retail sector with enhanced efficiencies. Shares in South Korea's largest listed company Samsung have sold off heavily since August, with shares down nearly 33% year-to-date, with concerns about the company losing its market share in the chip industry. We have caused concerns about our technical competitiveness, with some talking about the crisis facing Samsung, said Young Hyun Jun, vice chairman of Samsung's device solutions division. As leaders of the business, we take full responsibility for this.

Shares then rose in November afterSamsung announced a share buybackworth 10 trillion South Korean won to boost shareholder value. Production woes have weighed on Toyota shares this year, with the world's biggest automaker having reported adrop in outputfor the ninth month in a row in October. Figures from the Japanese carmaker released at the end of November showed that the Toyota part of the business, which included luxury brand Lexus but excluded Daihatsu and Hino, had produced 893,164 vehicles in October. This was down 0.8% year-on-year but was an improvement on the 8% fall recorded in September. Read more:Should investors bet on bonds or equities as Trump's presidency looms? However, sales from this part of the business rose for the first time in five months, up 1.4% year-on-year to 903,103 in October. In its second quarter results, Toyota reported a20% decline in operating incometo 1.16 trillion yen (£5.87bn), marking its first quarterly profit fall in two years. Toyota said it expected production to be normalised in the second half of the year. Declines its share price in the second half of the year mean the stock has risen just 7% year-to-date. Oil prices have been under pressure this year, over concerns about reduced demand. Prices have also fluctuated because of the conflict in the Middle East and weaker economic data out of China, as the world's largest importer of crude oil. The global oil market is set to be insurplus in 2025, according to a recent forecast from the International Energy Agency. That's despite OPEC+ – which controls about half of the world’s oil output – deciding to extend supply cuts. Read more:What can we expect for pensions in 2025? He said that ING expected ICE Brent, a benchmark for crude oil, to average $71 per barrel over 2025. The decline in prices has impacted the profits of Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco, with shares down 12% year-to-date. In the third quarter, Aramco reported that profits had fallen to $27.6bn from $32.6bn for the same period last year. The oil giant said that the fall in profits was mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins. However, Aramco still declared a base dividend of $20.3bn and a performance-linked payout of $10.8bn for the third quarter. Download the Yahoo Finance app, available forAppleandAndroid.",

Building a £100,000 second income is no easy feat. At least, not for those who don’t already have a seven-figure net worth. But by leveraging the power ofcompounding returnsin the stock market, building a passive income of this size in the long run is more achievable than most would think, even when starting with just £1,000. Let’s start by figuring out exactly how much a portfolio would need to grow to generate a six-figure income. On average, British dividend stocks offer a yield of 4%. But by being a bit more selective, it’s possible to push this to 5% without taking on too much extra risk. Yet, even with this slight boost, an investor would still need a £2m portfolio to hit the £100,000 income target. So how can investors turn £1,000 into £2m? One method is to dive into the realm of penny stocks. These are tiny companies. However, given enough time, they could develop into future industry leaders. After all, that’s precisely what’s happened with some of the largest companies in the world today. Fun fact: a £1,000 investment inApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) when it was a penny stock in 1986 is now worth over £3.1m. So all investors have to do is find the next Apple. Sadly, the vast majority of penny stocks fail to deliver, and investors are often left with nothing. In other words, this is an exceptionally high-risk strategy. No investment in thestock marketis risk-free. However, there are significantly safer ways to invest than penny stocks. And in many cases, these can still be highly lucrative if investors are willing to drip feed more money over time. For example, theFTSE 100’s generated a long-term average return of around 8%. However, by selecting individual high-quality stocks, it’s possible to boost this return. Even a 2% boost can make an enormous difference in the long run. And investing £500 a month on top of the £1,000 starting capital at 10% can build a £2m portfolio in about 35 years. Then it’s just a matter of switching strategies around from growth to dividends to start earning a £100,000 second income. Of course, this introduces a new challenge. What makes a stock high quality? Let’s zoom in again on Apple. What made it so successful? The firm’s cultivated enormous pricing power driven by a cult-like following from its customers. After all, it’s not uncommon to see massive queues lining up outside its stores whenever a newiPhone’s released. Such behaviour also signals a reputation for quality to non-Apple customers. And that might just be the convincing factor to convert a newiPhoneuser. This is just one of many competitive advantages Apple has leveraged over the years. Obviously, there are other factors to consider. Even Apple’s exposed to risks today, such as the brewing trade war between the US and China, where the firm manufactures most of its products. Nevertheless, filtering out companies that don’t have a discernible advantage over their rivals can quickly eliminate a lot of losing investments from consideration. Zaven Boyrazian has no position in any of the shares mentioned. The Motley Fool UK has recommended Apple.

      "content": "We recently compiled a list of theJim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve’s December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank’s median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed’s announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn’t doing that well. Look at the housing stocks. It isn’t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!” Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. And I come back and say why are they doing this,” said Cramer, adding “So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we’re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it’s not strong either if you count colds.” Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong.” Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed’s Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. I’m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” The American economy wasn’t the only economy on Cramer’s mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn’t a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers.” China is “getting away with murder, they really are, they’re getting away with wiping out industries all over the world,” Cramer said, adding that “there’s only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world and one whose valuation could touch $4 trillion soon. As it generates 51.6% of its revenue from the iPhone, the iconic smartphone lineup is baked into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s hypothesis. The stock responds to even the slightest of credible news of the smartphone either facing reduced demand or Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) deciding to lower its manufacturing orders to contract manufacturers. The high valuation approaching a $4 trillion market cap and the iPhone’s criticality was also on Cramer’s mind as he started by discussing how Apple Inc. . . .Well David, I mean one of the things that’s happening is is there’s people who just say we’re getting away from the cellphone cycle. . . it’s so far the biggest position in our trust. But I do think that if we can just get away from the [IPHONE] 17, or the 17 and 18, the 19, get away from that and make this much more of a service story. Now Tim Cook bridles if you say look, it’s Razor, Razor Blade. Because this is a tech company with the highest satisfaction. But I do think that if you could make it so that the service revenue is the thing and you’ve got China, without China orders [inaudible] so Apple’s no longer dependent on just China orders. And you get a higher multiple, but this multiple has to be followed up by a dynamite 2025. I don’t know what to say. Would I come in and buy the stock right now? I mean I’d think I’d wait for a bit of a comeback, it’s just been, it trades like uh, Oklo. And it’s Apple. Unbelievably great company. I don’t know what to do. How do you tell people to buy Apple at that multiple when it doesn’t have that kind of consistency. And you have to believe that what they do have is a plan to be able to, so that they are out of the cycle business.” Overall AAPLranks 3rdon our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

      "content": "Wall Street stocks closed higher on Friday as the blue-chip clawed back some of this week's heavy losses. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.18% at 42,840.26, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.09% to 5,930.85 and the Nasdaq Composite saw out the session 1.03% firmer at 19,572.60. The Dow closed 498.02 points higher on Friday, building on modest gains recorded in the previous session. Friday's primary focus was November's personal consumption expenditures index, which revealed Americans continued to spend at a steady clip last month, while prices rose slightly less than anticipated. According tothe Department of Commerce, in seasonally adjusted terms, personal incomes rose at a month-on-month clip of 0.3% during November, while personal spending increased by 0.4%. On the inflation front, the annual rate of increase in the price deflator for personal consumption expenditures ticked higher from 2.3% to 2.4%. Core PCE prices meanwhile were steady at 2.8% year-on-year (consensus: 2.9%). Elsewhere on the macro front, Consumer confidence in the US rose modestly, although inflation expectations were mixed, the results of a closely followed survey revealed. A final reading onthe University of Michigan's consumer confidence index for the month of December came in at 74.0, which was up from 71.8 one month before - in line with a preliminary reading and consensus forecasts. Also drawing some investor attention, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was more than five basis points lower at 4.519% after breaking above the 4.5% barrier earlier in the week.

Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more.Learn More The last five years have been incredible forNVIDIA Corp(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares. While the California-based chip designer was certainly not an unknown and had many admirers, few would have predicted that it would go on to surpassApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and become the world's most valuable company last month. And while a pullback in December means that it has now given back this crown to the iPhone maker, this doesn't make its last five years any less impressive. A key driver of Nvidia's impressive ascent has been the emergence of ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Soon after launch, the generative AI chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing consumer app in history by achieving a staggering 100 million monthly active users within two months. This was great news for Nvidia because its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other chips are well suited to make demanding applications like ChatGPT run. As a result, this has put a rocket under demand for its chips and underpinned stellar revenue and earnings growth. But what has it done for investors that put money into Nvidia shares five years ago? Let's find out. Firstly, it is worth noting that Nvidia has undertaken two stock splits during the past five years. As a result, the real price that investors would have paid to buy its shares in 2019 will be different to the adjusted price. However, everything else remains the same (returns etc). This means that with a US$5,000 investment, investors would have ended up with 836 shares in their portfolio. As of Thursday's close on Wall Street, the Nvidia share price was changing hands for a lofty US$130.68. This means that those 836 shares now have a market value of approximatelyUS$109,250. That's almost US$105,000 more than they started with. In fact, their original US$5,000 investment accounts for just 4.6% of their holding now. The rest is pure profit. The good news is that there could be more gains to come as well. A recent note fromWell Fargo(NYSE: WFC) reveals that its analysts have put an overweight rating and US$185.00 price target on its shares. This implies potential upside of almost 42% for investors at the time of writing. Here's hoping this is the start of more great returns for shareholders of this high-quality company.

      "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board followingcommentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to beChatGPT-maker OpenAIandApple(AAPL),boosted the chipmaker’s stocklast week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down.Commentary from Microsoftand Googlein their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there areconcernsthat AI models are no longer improvingat their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate. Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks Wall Street analysts can’t stop talking about. Henry Ajder, Latent Space Advisory founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that lack of fresh data remains a key challenge for the performance of AI systems after a period of “huge” developments and fast learning. We have a finite amount of data available on the internet and a limited number of sources for live, fresh data. I believe this is becoming an increasingly significant challenge, especially as legal issues surrounding how companies obtain and use data are becoming more prominent,” the analyst said. Ajder believes there won’t be a complete “halt” to the progress in AI systems but in 2025 we are expected to see a slowdown. Answering a question about the AI’s ability to make up data, called synthetic data” to train itself, the analyst said this domain has shown promise but there are risks of synthetic data potentially corrupting the training models.

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said while talking to CNBC earlier this month that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that should worry investors. And every product, you know, people go, ‘Oh my God, Vision Pro is going to be terrific,’ and then you figure out, no, nobody’s going to wear ski goggles on their head. Then you look at what’s going on with the iPhone and the features they’ve rolled out, which surprised me because they weren’t particularly good to start with. They’re going to get upgraded in December in the US, but then you have to wait for next year for it to be upgraded in the rest of the world. And you’ve got a company that’s also trading at a 33 P/E for 5% revenue growth over the past three years combined. So that’s the other one where if people finally go, ‘You know what? The problem isn’t this. It’s market share losses to people like Huawei that have resurged in China.’” Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of stocks Wall Street analysts can’t stop talking about.

Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Cheng Xin/Getty Images Major U.S. equities indexes plunged as the Federal Reserve concluded its final policy meeting of the year. Thecentral bank loweredbenchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, but policymakers suggested that persistent inflation could require a more restrained approach in 2025. After trading higher for much of the day, the S&P 500 changed course following the rate-cut announcement and as Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the press, ending with a daily loss of 3%. The Dow finished the session down 2.6%, extending its streak of down days to double digits for the first time in four decades. The Nasdaq dropped 3.6% as concerns about the interest-rate outlook weighed on the tech sector. Shares of human resources services provider Paycom Software (PAYC) dropped 10.1% on Wednesday, the most of any S&P 500 constituent. Concerns about cannibalization have weighed on Paycom stock over the past year, with the efficiency of its Beti automated payroll solution reportedly eating into demand for other products and services. Tesla (TSLA) shares tumbled 8.3%, retreating fromrecord highs printed in recent sessionsin the wake of upgrades by several research firms. Analysts have touted tailwinds for the electric vehicle company's autonomous driving and artificial intelligence initiatives under the incoming presidential administration. The pullback for the stock on Wednesday followed reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his SpaceX business are the subject of federal reviews related to national security concerns. Shares of BXP (BXP), areal estate investment trust (REIT)focused on premium office properties, fell 7.6%. Following a series of gains that lifted the semiconductor maker above the$1 trillion market capitalization milestone, Broadcom (AVGO) shares declined for a second straight day, losing 6.9%. Although Broadcom's AI-driven earnings beat and positive outlook encouraged a slew of research firms to boost their price targets, the recent rally lifted the share price above analysts' average forecast, suggesting the stock may be fully valued at current levels. Wednesday's top performance in the S&P 500 came from shares of circuit board manufacturer Jabil (JBL), which surged 7.3%. The Apple (AAPL) suppliertopped sales and profit forecastsfor its fiscal first quarter of 2025 and lifted its full-year guidance, pointing to robust demand for its cloud, data center infrastructure, and digital commerce products. Jabilannounced a restructuring planearlier this year that included layoffs and other cost-cutting measures as well as a realignment of its manufacturing capacity. Shares of several healthcare companies bounced higher on Wednesday, clawing back some of the heavy losses posted in recent sessions as political headwinds against thepharmacy benefit management (PBM)business gathered force. Although the industry has been the subject of bipartisan criticism and could be required to transform its business model, analysts suggested that growth outlook remains healthy. Cigna (CI) shares recovered 6.3%. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), and CVS Health (CVS) also regained ground.",

      "content": "Spencer Platt / Getty Images Stocks tumbled Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate, as had been expected, but indicated it will slow down the pace of future reductions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.6%, losing more than 1,100 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 3% and 3.6%, respectively. Those were the worst one-day losses for the Dow and S&P 500 since August, while the Nasdaq had its worst day since July. The Dow has now finished lower in10 consecutive sessions, its longest streak of daily losses since 1974. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is tied to expectations about where interest rates are headed, rose to 4.51%, up from 4.39% before the Fed's announcement and trading at its highest level since May. The selloff in stocks after the Fed announcements was broad-based, but the sectors that are most sensitive to the possibility of rates remaining high for longer than expected got hit the hardest this afternoon. The S&P 500's Consumer Discretionary and Real Estate sectors fell 4.7% and 4%, respectively. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks slid 4.4%. Large-cap technology stocks were down across the board. Tesla (TSLA) was down 8.3%, giving back some of the post-election gains that have sent the stock to a series of record highs, while Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Broadcom (AVGO) also lost ground. Shares of Micron (MU) fell 4.3% ahead of the release after the closing bell of the chipmaker's quarterly earnings report. The stock dropped an additional 15% in after-hours trading. Gold futures were down 2% at around $2,600 an ounce, while crude oil futures fell slightly. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner projected fiscal second-quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, give or take $200 million, below the analyst consensus of $8.93 billion compiled by Visible Alpha. The company's forecast for dilutedearnings per share (EPS)of between $1.16 to $1.36 was also below estimates. “While consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release. In its fiscal first quarter, which ended Nov. 28, Micron swung to a better-than-expected profit of $1.87 billion, or $1.67 per share, from a loss of $1.23 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 84% to a record $8.71 billion, just below analysts' estimates and just above the midpoint of management's earlier guidance. Shares of Micron were down 13% in recent after-hours trading. They were up nearly 22% for 2024 through Wednesday’s close. -Kara Greenberg S&P 500 and Dow Post Biggest One-Day Losses Since August Stocks had their worst day in months on Wednesday after the Fed policymakers scaled back their forecast for future rate cuts and noted their uncertainty about the path of inflation had increased over the past few months. The Dow and the S&P 500 each suffered their largest daily declinessince August 5, tumbling 2.6% and 3%, respectively. That was the day theyen carry trade, a leveraged investment strategy that was enormously popular on Wall Street, backfired and caused the worst stock market rout since 2022. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3.6%, making Wednesday its worst daysince July 24when disappointing earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) sparked a tech sector sell-off. -Colin Laidely Fed Says Today's Rate Cut Was a Close Call Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the decision to cut rates today was closer than in past meetings. We thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability, Powell said. We see the risks as two-sided. Move too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity in the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we're trying to steer between those two risks, and on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. Powell Says Economy and Policy are Both in a Good Place Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to reporters after the December meeting of the Fed's policy committee, said that the U.S. economy and monetary policy are both in a good place. He said that growth has been higher than expected lately, while unemployment has been lower than anticipated. At the same time, inflation has been higher than expected, even as the Fed has made progress in its efforts to tame it. Powell said the central bank is still working to balance its dual mandate of maximum employment and low inflation. With employment remaining stable and inflation staying stubborn, central bankers can be less aggressive in the upcoming year. With today's action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive, Powell said. We can, therefore, be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. Fed Cuts Key Rate But Expects to Slow Pace of Further Easing The Federal Reserve cut itsfederal funds rateby a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This is the third cut central bankers have made in as many meetings and brings the fed funds rate range to a full percentage point lower than it was at the start of the year. There was one dissenting vote to the policy move, cast by Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack. Members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee are now projecting just two additional cuts next year, according to the latest Summary of Economic Projections, compared to the four cuts they had previously expected. You can follow our coverage of the Fed decision, including Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, in theFed Meeting Live Blog. Here's Why Dow is Having Its Worst Slump in 40 Years The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher in intraday trading Wednesday after falling yesterdayfor a ninth consecutive session, capping off its longest stretch of daily losses since 1978. The blue chip index slumped 3.5% during its latest losing streak, while the S&P 500 gave up just 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%. So why have these three major indexes, each containing the stocks of some of America’s largest companies, diverged lately? The killing of a UnitedHealth Group executive earlier this month has put a spotlight on the business of health care, weighing on stocks in the sector and, subsequently, the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia, one of the Dow's newest members, has also trailed the market and dragged down the index in recent weeks.

The firm, which counts Apple (AAPL) as a customer, reported fiscal 2025 first-quarter adjustedearnings per share (EPS)of $2.00, with revenue falling nearly 17% year-over-year to $6.99 billion. Both beat consensus forecasts of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Chief Executive Officer Mike Dastoor said the performance exceeded the company's expectations, driven by incremental strength in our Cloud, Data Center Infrastructure, and Digital Commerce end-markets. In September, Jabilsaidit would be instituting layoffs across itsselling, general and administrative (SG&A)and manufacturing cost base, as well as capacity realignment, in order to align our support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. The company now sees full-year adjusted EPS of $8.75, up from its earlier outlook of $8.65. It anticipates revenue of $27.3 billion, versus its previous estimate of $27.0 billion. Jabil shares were up 10% in recent trading. The stock has now gained 16% since the start of the year, lagging the S&P 500's 27% increase over the period. Shares in the AI investor favorite were up 3.6% at around $135 in recent trading. The stock is down 13% from its record high last month but is still up about 175% since the start of 2024, asanalysts remain bullishon the company’s prospects heading into next year. Since setting a record high, the stock traded mostly sideways before falling below the 50-day moving average late last week, potentially setting the stage for further consolidation. Investors should watch key support levels on Nvidia's chart around $115 and $102, while also monitoring important resistance levels near $140 and $150. Read the fulltechnical analysis piece here. The shoemaker on Wednesday reported profit of 52.5 million euros ($55.1 million) on revenue of 455.8 million euros ($478.2 million). Analysts had expected EUR48 million in net income on revenue of EUR437.2 million, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. TradingView Birkenstock shares were up 7% in early trading. The stock is up 23% since the start of the year, lagging the 27% gain of the S&P 500 index. -Aaron McDade DJIA Levels to Watch as Index Rides 9-Day Losing Streak The Dow Jones Industrial Average enters trading Wednesday on a nine-day losing streak, the longest stretch of consecutive daily declines for the blue chip index since 1978. The slump, which equates to nearly 1,600points, comes after the index closed above the closely watched 45,000 level for the first time on Dec. 4 following an extended post-election rally fueled by expectations of a market-friendly White House and Congress. Despite the recent losing streak, the index is still up 15% in 2024. However, that return significantly underperforms theS&P 500’s27% gain and theNasdaq Composite’s34% jump over the same period due to the Dow's smaller exposure tomega captech companies. The index has continued to trend lower after running into resistance near the top trendline of an ascending channel earlier this month, raising the possibility of a potential breakdown. Investors should watch major support levels on the Dow's chart around 43,300, 41,600, and 40,000, while also monitoring a key overhead area near 45,000.

      "content": "Bitcoin’s soaring valuehas caught the attention of high-end fashion brands and retailers, prompting further interest in offering cryptocurrencies as a means of payment to tap in to fresh pockets of wealth and build loyalty with crypto investors. Until recently, only a handful of luxury brands including LVMH(LVMH.PA)watch labels Hublot and Tag Heuer as well as Kering-owned(PRTP.PA),fashion brands Gucci and Balenciaga have experimented with crypto payment offers. In recent weeks, upscale French luxury department store Printemps announced it was teaming up with the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, and French financial tech company Lyzi to accept cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum in its stores in France – becoming the first European department store to do so. The move, coming as bitcoin rises, has been noticed by other brands and retailers who are showing interest in joining in. “There have been quite a few calls – it’s generated interest,” said David Princay, president of Binance France, who said the company is in talks with other luxury labels. Luxury lighter and pen maker S.T. Dupont told Reuters it aims to accept cryptocurrency payments in two Paris stores before the holidays. In the realm of experiences, cruise company Virgin Voyages began this month offering its first product accepting bitcoin as a payment option – a $120,000 annual pass for up to a year of sailing on its cruise sunder Trump, you’re going to have a deregulatory environment, which is a huge positive.ips.And I think when you look what’s happening in the Beltwayunder Trump, you’re going to have a deregulatory environment, which is a huge positive. President-electDonald Trump, who is expected to bring in more friendly e-currency regulation, have fueledrecord-breaking rises for bitcoin. S&P analysts say the narrative is starting to shift, noting that blockchain innovation in financial markets could increase predictability for cryptocurrencies. Luxury labels have long sought to cater to affluent shoppers from the tech industry by opening stores in upscale Silicon Valley malls and issuing products like the Hermes(HRMS.PA),Apple Watch, for example, which combines signature, stitched leather straps of the French Birkin bag maker with tech giant Apple’s(AAPL.O),connected timepiece. Now, new wealth generated by bitcoin’s recent highs – topping $107,000 on Monday – comes as the luxury industry faces itsbiggest slump in yearsand searches for new sources of growth. Offering cryptocurrency payments can be a way for companies to brand themselves as innovative rather than “a stuffy old brand that’s only selling to the boomers,” said Andrew O’Neill, digital assets lead analyst at S&P Global Ratings. The payment option remains largely symbolic. Retailers usually reconvert the funds to euros or dollars to offset risks of volatility, while for most shoppers, payment methods are seen overall as “something that’s been solved” already by such transaction platforms as PayPal(PYPL.O)or Venmo, said O’Neill. But for bitcoin investors who have seen a strong rise in the value of their investment, luxury goods – a designer handbag or high-end watch – are an obvious choice for diversifying one’s portfolio, analysts say. In a sign of growing interest from designer labels, Balenciaga recently issued a leather card holder designed to hold “Stax” hardware from crypto wallet company Ledger. The black leather accessory, which retails for 350 euros ($368), includes a keychain and Eiffel Tower charm, and an NFC chip fitted underneath the brand logo. Ledger’s Stax Crypto hardware, its recently developed higher-end hardware with a curved touch screen, sells for $399 at Best Buy(BBY.N),. The company’s “Flex” hardware, which resembles a mini Amazon Kindle, sells for $249 while the “Nano” version, which looks like a USB key, sells for $79. Gregory Boutte, chief client and digital officer for luxury conglomerate Kering, has described the group’s strategy when it comes to technology as “test and learn” rather than “wait and see.” He emphasized the embrace of new technologies as key to reaching younger and Asian clientele. Kering’s star label, Gucci, has since 2022 made purchases available through 10 cryptocurrencies for most of its products in the United States. Printemps is working to expand its crypto payments service to New York City, where it plans to open a multibrand retailer in the Wall Street district in March. Bitcoin’s rise in late 2021 prompted an initial flurry of interest from luxury brands with Tag Heuer, headed at the time by LVMH luxury scion Frederic Arnault, as well as Gucci, accepting payments in cryptocurrency the following year for some purchases in the United States. One crypto advocate who recently used digital assets to make luxury purchases is Eunice Wong, an investor and influencer known as “Eunicorn.” Wong said she used cryptocurrency to buy several high-end watches this year including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak model. But she is not interested in being drawn in by high end brands seeking to build a closer client relationship, preferring to bypass traditional retail stores and sales routines. “If I will buy, I’ll buy on the secondary market, not through them,” she told Reuters. “I want it now.” Source: www.reuters.com",
