      "content": "December 27, 2024Ron Haruni On CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime,”Dan Ives,Wedbush‘s global head of technology research, shared his insights on Apple’s recent performance and its potential path to a $5 trillion market cap, primarily driven by an anticipated AI upgrade cycle. Ives recentlyraisedhis price target for Apple (AAPL) to a Street-High of $325 from $300, maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares, attributing his optimism to recent channel checks indicating a robust holiday season, projecting Apple to sell 240 million iPhones this year. Despite Apple’s stock trading at high multiples compared to its earnings, Ives dismissed concerns about overvaluation. He argued that Apple’s services business alone could justify a $2 trillion valuation, and with AI integration, revenue could increase significantly, potentially adding $5 to $10 billion annually. This, combined with what he believes will be an underestimated growth in iPhone sales, could push Apple’s valuation far beyond current expectations. He emphasized thatApple Intelligence, part of the iOS 18.2 update, would catalyze this cycle, with hundreds of new AI-driven apps expected to enhance the iPhone ecosystem. He believes that the integration of AI will not only drive iPhone upgrades but also extend across Apple’s entire product line, including iPads and Macs, marking the beginning of a multi-year AI-driven upgrade super cycle. Ives concluded that the current market cap of Apple, around $3.92 trillion, does not reflect the potential growth from AI monetization. He predicts that as AI penetration in Apple’s ecosystem grows from 15% to 25-30%, the company could feasibly reach a$5 trillion valuationwithin the next 12 to 18 months. His vision is for Apple to lead the consumer AI revolution, countering any skepticism with a firm belief in Apple’s strategic position and future growth trajectory.",

      "content": "In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. An Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that the data around Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone has been “disappointing.” “Relative to three months ago, the data, if you actually take a look at it, has been somewhat disappointing, with the rollout being much slower. In other words, you’re going to get another update to Apple Intelligence, which is their AI features, in December. So for me, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not one I would really be that bullish on right here. It’s just going up with the tape, but I think as we get closer to them having to report and guide, you may have an issue.” Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models In the latest earnings call, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook highlighted new features for the iPhone, such as a more comfortable watch band and sleep apnea detection, but none appeared to be major demand drivers for new customers. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in itsQ3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.",

      "content": "December 24, 2024Ari Haruni Apple‘s(AAPL)stock has recently soared to new all-time highs/$258.21, inching closer to a$4 trillionmarket capitalization, driven largely by the optimism surrounding AI’s potential to spark a significant upgrade cycle for the iPhone. During a discussion on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’,Tom Forte, a senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group, shared his perspectives on this surge and his ongoing hold rating on Apple’s stock. Forte attributes the recent run-up in Apple’s stock to an AI-fueled rally, with expectations high that AI enhancements will lead to a major iPhone upgrade cycle. Currently trading well above 30 times its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple’s valuation is at or above its peers who are also benefiting from the AI surge. Forte points out that even with an anticipated upgrade cycle, Apple’s earnings per share (EPS) growth over the next couple of years looks to be in the mid to high single digits, suggesting that the stock might be overpriced relative to its growth prospects. He also notes the ongoing education of consumers by companies like Google (GOOG) and Apple about the benefits of AI in smartphones, indicating that the demand for AI-driven upgrades is not yet a certainty. Forte has maintained his ‘hold’ rating since Apple’s developers conference where they unveiled their AI strategy, observing the market’s reaction but waiting for clear evidence of how AI will translate into earnings growth for Apple. Discussing Apple’s potential move into home security with a new camera akin to Amazon’s Ring, Forte acknowledges Apple’s extensive installed base with the iPhone but expresses doubt about the impact of this venture on Apple’s financials. Given Apple’s size, he suggests that while such a product might add marginal earnings, perhaps around 10 cents per share, it wouldn’t significantly move the needle, especially when the iPhone still constitutes about half of Apple’s revenue. In essence, while the market celebrates Apple’s AI advancements and the potential for an upgrade cycle, Forte’s analysis suggests a more measured approach, focusing on valuation, the timing and impact of AI integration, and the comparative scale of new product entries against Apple’s massive revenue base.",

Despite high hopes, a potential plateau in performance improvements in AI systems, high energy consumption of AI data centers and transparency remain key issues tech companies will continue to grapple with in 2025. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Tom Forte, Maxim Group senior consumer internet analyst, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an expensive stock. When you look at the next couple of years for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), on what looks to be a very slow-developing upgrade cycle, if there is a major upgrade cycle, you’re looking at mid to high single-digit EPS growth. So, north of 30 times PE, mid single-digit to high single-digit EPS growth—I think it’s, you know, an expensive stock.” Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in itsQ3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose during the quarter, making our underweight position a relative detractor. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is investing in Apple Intelligence, an AI-driven initiative that is expected to bolster the iPhone product line. While iPhone sales have appeared subdued in recent years, the integration of AI features is one factor expected to give people a reason to upgrade, strengthening Apple’s revenue base. While the hardware business has been a key growth driver over the years, the service segment also affirms Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term prospects. Likewise, the expectation is high that Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) gross margin will improve next year owing to cost efficiencies and faster-growing service revenue, allowing the company to generate more shareholder value.

The analysts raised their price target for Apple's stock by $25 to $325 and maintained an outperform rating, anticipating a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI that “is still being underestimated by the Street. That's a lot higher than the average analyst price target compiled by Visible Alpha at about $244. Apple shares were up slightly in midday trading after hitting a fresh all-time high of just over $260. Wedbush's target boost comes as the firm projects Apple could sell more than 240 million iPhones in fiscal year 2025, “as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold and this will be the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple's history.” TradingView Apple shares have gained over one-third of their value since the start of the year, as the company'smarket capitalizationnears $4 trillion. (See chart above) Wedbush expects Apple could soon reach that $4 trillion threshold, which would make it the first company in the world to do so. At present, there are only three companies with a market caps over $3 trillion, including Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT).",

      "content": "We recently compiled a list of theJim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world and one whose valuation could touch $4 trillion soon. As it generates 51.6% of its revenue from the iPhone, the iconic smartphone lineup is baked into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s hypothesis. The stock responds to even the slightest of credible news of the smartphone either facing reduced demand or Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) deciding to lower its manufacturing orders to contract manufacturers. The high valuation approaching a $4 trillion market cap and the iPhone’s criticality was also on Cramer’s mind as he started by discussing how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s high P/E ratio hasn’t dissuaded buyers: “And people will not stop buying it. But I do think that if you could make it so that the service revenue is the thing and you’ve got China, without China orders [inaudible] so Apple’s no longer dependent on just China orders. And it’s Apple. How do you tell people to buy Apple at that multiple when it doesn’t have that kind of consistency. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.",
