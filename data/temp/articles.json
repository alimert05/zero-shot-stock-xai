      "content": "December 27, 2024Ron Haruni On CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime,”Dan Ives,Wedbush‘s global head of technology research, shared his insights on Apple’s recent performance and its potential path to a $5 trillion market cap, primarily driven by an anticipated AI upgrade cycle. Ives recentlyraisedhis price target for Apple (AAPL) to a Street-High of $325 from $300, maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares, attributing his optimism to recent channel checks indicating a robust holiday season, projecting Apple to sell 240 million iPhones this year. Despite Apple’s stock trading at high multiples compared to its earnings, Ives dismissed concerns about overvaluation. He argued that Apple’s services business alone could justify a $2 trillion valuation, and with AI integration, revenue could increase significantly, potentially adding $5 to $10 billion annually. This, combined with what he believes will be an underestimated growth in iPhone sales, could push Apple’s valuation far beyond current expectations. Ives addressed concerns about consumer behavior amidst inflation, noting that while it might affect upgrades marginally, the real driver for upgrades is the vast number of iPhones—300 million out of 1.5 billion globally—that haven’t been upgraded in over four years. He emphasized thatApple Intelligence, part of the iOS 18.2 update, would catalyze this cycle, with hundreds of new AI-driven apps expected to enhance the iPhone ecosystem. Responding to comparisons with the lukewarm reception to AI PCs by companies like HP (HPE) and Dell (DELL), Ives highlighted the unique upgrade cycle for smartphones, which typically occurs every 2.5 to 3 years but has now extended to 4 years, creating pent-up demand. He believes that the integration of AI will not only drive iPhone upgrades but also extend across Apple’s entire product line, including iPads and Macs, marking the beginning of a multi-year AI-driven upgrade super cycle. Ives concluded that the current market cap of Apple, around $3.92 trillion, does not reflect the potential growth from AI monetization. He predicts that as AI penetration in Apple’s ecosystem grows from 15% to 25-30%, the company could feasibly reach a$5 trillion valuationwithin the next 12 to 18 months. His vision is for Apple to lead the consumer AI revolution, countering any skepticism with a firm belief in Apple’s strategic position and future growth trajectory.

Over the years, he has developed software and hardware to gain an edge in investment opportunities. Born in 1951, David E. Shaw became a successful billionaire scientist and hedge fund manager. After earning a PhD from Stanford in 1980, he foundedD.E. Shaw & Co.in 1988 with six employees and $28 million in capital.

Shaw Composite Fund, gained 9.6% in 2023, outperforming the HFR Global Hedge Fund Index, which was up about 2.5% through December 15. Reuters added that D.E. Shaw’s macro-oriented fund, the Oculus Fund, gained 7.8% in 2023, beating its macroeconomic peers. According to Bloomberg, the Oculus Fund has never had a negative year since it started.

While iPhone sales have appeared subdued in recent years, the integration of AI features is one factor expected to give people a reason to upgrade, strengthening Apple’s revenue base.

The rally in shares of the magnificent seven, which includes Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) are at risk of stagnating. Yields for the 30-year T-bill are especially notable. The 30-year yield is 4.77% while the 10-year T-bill is at 4.59%. This will increase mortgage rates, hurting the demand for homes. Since peaking in August, D.H. DHI stock is down by 29% from its high for the year. Yields are rising because the Fed changed from a dovish, rate-cutting tone it set in the summer. In December, Fed Chair Powell said that the central bank needs to beware of inflation that U.S. tariffs cause. When the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canadian imports, those countries will retaliate. This increases the price of consumer goods for Americans. The U.S. government is hoping that neither trading partner will counter with similarly sized tariffs. Watch out for the risk of the Santa Claus rally fading quickly to start 2025. Markets trade at a premium since they are not pricing in the trade war risks.",

Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. “There’s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). “They reported $35 billion in one quarter, which is three months. They had a total of $27 billion over 12 months last year. That means in three months, they exceeded their entire 2023 earnings by $8 billion. I’m not sure there’s a stock in the history of the exchange that has driven that much in revenue, while also achieving 50% margins. If you do the math on that $35 billion a quarter, they’re already on a $140 billion annual clip in terms of revenue. In order to achieve the prediction of $800 by 2030, they need to be at $600 billion in revenue. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips.

Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Revenue Growth:Apple's revenue growth over a period of 3 months has been noteworthy. As of 30 September, 2024, the company achieved a revenue growth rate of approximately6.07%. This indicates a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings. As compared to its peers, the revenue growth lags behind its industry peers. The company achieved a growth rate lower than the average among peers in Information Technology sector.",

      "content": "US stocks finished Monday's session higher despite a batch of mixed economic data, with the Dow rising for the third straight day as indices continue their attempted recovery from last week's sell-off. Nevertheless, Wall Street trading was expected to be somewhat muted this week, with the NYSE shutting up shop early on Tuesday for the festive break and not opening again until Thursday. Orders were down 1.1% in November, after a 0.8% gain in October, worse than the 0.4% decline expected by the market. Elsewhere, consumer sentiment in the US unexpectedly declined in December, pulling back after strong gains over the previous two months as concerns about the future outlook returned. The Conference Board's closely followed consumer confidence index fell to 104.7 this month from 112.8 in November, surprising analysts who had forecast a small improvement to 112.9. Meanwhile, new home sales rose by 5.9% to 664,000 in November, slightly ahead of the 650,000 consensus estimate, but only partially rebounding after the revised 14.8% slump registered the month before. Under the terms of the deal, shareholders will receive $24.25 a share in cash, a 42% premium to the closing price on 18 March – the day before M&A speculation began – though this was slightly below Friday's closing price.

Warren Buffettis entering 2025 with the largest cash reserve atBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) in over three decades. What Happened: The conglomerate’s cash holdings have reached a staggering $325 billion, marking the highest percentage of total assets since 1990, CNBCreportedon Tuesday. This cash accumulation comes as Buffett, 94, finds few attractive investment opportunities amid a highly valued market. The “Buffett indicator,” which compares the total market value of U.S. stocks to GDP, has soared to 209%, a level not seen since the 1929 market peak, according to Oppenheimer data. Throughout 2024, Buffett sold significant portions of his largest holdings, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andBank of America Corp.(NYSE:BAC), offloading $133 billion in stocks during the year’s first three quarters. AnalystKevin Healfrom Argus Research suggests that some of the cash could be used for investments in distressed situations, allowing successors to leave their mark. This will also provide an opportunity for the successors to make their own mark when Mr. Buffett ocially hands over the reins. Why It Matters: This substantial cash reserve positions Berkshire Hathaway for strategic maneuvers in the coming years. Recently, Buffett’s investment activities have shown a shift. This move, totaling around $405 million, raised Berkshire’s ownership to 28% of Occidental, valued at approximately $12 billion. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

      "content": "We recently published a list ofAnalysts Are Talking About These 10 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks analysts are talking about. He used the analogy of a child raised in a library, now ready to step out into the world. “What if they, we make them interact with sensory data, with vision data, with, uh, you know, like basically opening that door of the library and making this child walk into the real world? I think this creation of word models, like they’re called generally in the industry, where you combine multimodal information, that is not only text but is also videos, but is also sensory data. Despite high hopes, a potential plateau in performance improvements in AI systems, high energy consumption of AI data centers and transparency remain key issues tech companies will continue to grapple with in 2025. READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending based on latest news and analyst ratings. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. “If you look at the valuation, it’s trading well north of 30 times on a PE basis, which is at or above its peers who are also taking advantage of this AI-fueled rally. When you look at the next couple of years for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), on what looks to be a very slow-developing upgrade cycle, if there is a major upgrade cycle, you’re looking at mid to high single-digit EPS growth. So, north of 30 times PE, mid single-digit to high single-digit EPS growth—I think it’s, you know, an expensive stock.” Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes for the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. While the company is projected to achieve 9.5% EPS growth this fiscal year and 12.3% growth in the next, much of this growth is already priced in, as the stock trades at nearly 30 times the expected EPS for the fiscal year ending September 2026. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of stocks analysts are talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

What Happened: Speaking on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” IvesdescribedTrump’s incoming administration as a “Goldilocks scenario” for tech companies, citing expected regulatory relief from agencies including the Federal Trade Commission. “Let’s get the popcorn out for what will be the AI revolution,” Ives said, emphasizing that the sector’s current surge is “just getting started.” He explained that AI’s multiplier effect is spreading across the technology landscape, impacting everything from software to cybersecurity infrastructure. The analyst expects 80% to 90% of regulatory concerns to diminish under Trump, though some Department of Justice antitrust investigations into companies likeAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) will continue. Addressing current tech adoption, Ives noted that only 45% of workloads currently operate in cloud environments, predicting a dramatic increase as more AI use cases emerge. “It’s 10:00 p.m. in the AI party, and now the velvet ropes are open,” he said. The forecast comes as multiple tech CEOs plan meetings with the president-elect in Palm Beach, signaling potentially closer cooperation between Silicon Valley and the incoming administration.

      "content": "December 31, 2024Ari Haruni Wedbush Securitieshasprojecteda significant uptick in tech stock performance for 2025, estimating a 25% increase driven by multiple converging factors. The firm highlights a decrease in regulatory constraints anticipated under a Trump administration, suggesting that the days of stringent oversight by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Lina Khan are behind us. This shift is expected to create a more favorable environment for Big Tech, particularly with enhanced AI initiatives from the government, which Wedbush describes as setting a “goldilocks foundation” for tech giants like Tesla and others. The core of Wedbush’s bullish outlook for 2025 centers on the ongoing AI Revolution, which they predict will inject over $2 trillion in additional capital expenditure into the tech sector over the next three years. This massive investment is expected to fuel growth across various tech companies, particularly those at the forefront of AI development and application. However, the journey to this growth isn’t expected to be without its challenges. Wedbush foresees “white-knuckle moments” due to concerns over Federal Reserve policies, potential escalations in U.S.-China trade relations concerning tariffs, and debates over the valuations of tech stocks which might be seen as stretched by some market observers. Despite these potential hurdles, these are viewed by Wedbush as opportunities to invest in key tech names, aligning with their investment strategy for the past two years. Wedbush has identified what they consider to be the top 10 tech companies poised to capitalize on the AI Revolution in 2025. Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) are noted for their comprehensive ecosystems where AI enhances user experiences across devices and services. MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW) are highlighted for their innovations in database management, crucial for handling the vast data sets AI requires. The integration of AI across these companies’ offerings – from hardware acceleration in Nvidia to enterprise software solutions in Salesforce -illustrates a tech sector increasingly defined by AI’s capabilities and potential. The predicted 25% growth in tech stocks underscores a belief in the enduring impact of AI, alongside a supportive political and economic backdrop, positioning these companies for significant gains in the near term. However, investors are advised to be prepared for volatility, as the road to such growth will likely be marked by both opportunities and risks.

      "content": "A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes. Fed chair Powell dropped a big lump of coal in the market’s stocking last week as he reigned in the Fed’s rate cut projections for 2025. While the Fed cut its key benchmark rate by the expected 25 basis points, Powell tempered expectations on future rate cuts based on sticky inflation data and the continued robust spending from American consumers. The Fed's so-called ‘dot plot,' which anticipates the frequency and strength of future rate activity, now indicates only two rate cuts in 2025, with a Fed funds rate at 3.75% – 4.00% by the end of next December. Markets did not take kindly to the news, and major indices closed starkly lower after being flat for most of the day. Nasdaq led the losers, with the tech-heavy index dropping more than 3.5%. After hours, AI-darling Micron Technology added to the pain with a significant earnings miss, and the stock had itsworst performance since March 2020the following day. Add in a close-call government shutdown and low holiday trading volume, and it was the perfect storm for some year-end volatility. And it won’t stop there. A cautious Fed means cautious investors and a change in strategy is necessary for 2025. Is this the end of the AI-infused tech rally? The prospects of rate reductions slashing capital costs and juicing stock prices have diminished, and AI stocks are beginning to see some cracks form. While AI isn't exiting the investment landscape anytime soon, the big winners over the last two years look to be finally taking a breather. In their place, we've identified five tech stocks not dependent on AI that could lead the way in 2025. seems to battle antitrust action every few years, causing a drawdown that eventually rebounds once investors realize the company still makes boatloads of cash every quarter. The stock slumped in the summer following a poor earnings report and again in November on (you guessed it)antitrust concerns, but it’s currently back near all-time highs. The company finally posted a positive annual net income figure in 2023, and the stock rallied from $25 to $80 between December 2022 and February 2024. But the rally stalled there, and the stock bounced between $60 and $80 for most of the last nine months. CACI International provides cybersecurity, cyberspace and digital solutions for domestic and international clients. CACI shares may have been unfairly unloaded as the price plunged down to $400 after approaching $580 in early November. The RSI reading of 27 indicates an oversold stock, and the company has good fundamentals with a 19.9 P/E ratio and a consensus Buy rating from analysts. Sometimes, you don't need to overthink it. Apple has been one of the biggest winners in the tech sector since Trump's election, and the company's cash pile is the envy of the business world. Despite already being one of the largest companies in the world by market cap, investors may have an opportunity here as the AI rally spins down. AAPL is a staple in any long-term investment portfolio, but the time is ripe to add more shares. The stock has been roaring upward since May 2024 and made another new all-time high as the third week of December came to a close. AAPL is now approaching a $4 trillion market cap, and its rally could continue in 2025 if the company is granted tariff exemptions similar to the ones it received during the first Trump administration.

Additionally, Waymo is one of the most significant success stories related to autonomous driving to date. The companyrecently announceda new service in Tokyo, its first international city, and recent testing data continues to show impressivesafety statistics. We think this recent drawdown is overdone, and the stock could be poised for a rally in 2025. Despite the proliferation of Waymo, Uber is still the dominant force in rideshare, and its ride-hailing market share is actually expanding compared to its biggest rival, Lyft. From a technical standpoint, the stock is oversold according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 50-day moving average is still hovering above the 200-day MA. As long as the 50-day stays above the 200-day, UBER shares might be an interesting buy at this level. As mentioned above, if AI takes a breather over the next few months, one investment theme that could emerge is quantum computing. used to be known as Innovative Beverage Group, which raises some questions about its dedication to the industry. There may be better choices to take advantage of this trend, like Rigetti Computing Inc. RGTI shares also experienced a meteoric rise over the last month, but not at the level of QUBT despite a much longer history in the quantum computing space. That could be a good development for investors, as Rigetti is better positioned to thrive if quantum computing takes off thanks to itsinnovative product lineand decade-plus history in the industry.",

      "content": "Stock Will Join Nasdaq 100 Index on Monday Mrinalini Krishna is a former Senior Editor of investing news at Investopedia. Shares of the company have gained more than 400% since the start of 2024, as bitcoin has surged to record highs above $100,000 amid optimism that the digital currency will benefit from policies that the incoming Trump administration and a crypto-supportive Congress are likely to put in place. MicroStrategy, little known to most investors before this year's rally, is now stepping further into the spotlight as itjoins the Nasdaq 100 Index, which comprises many of the largest, most actively traded companies in the world, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). As a result, exchange-traded funds that track the index, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), have to adjust their portfolios to include MicroStrategy. However, some investors have said the blockbuster stock price gains aren't sustainable, in part because of the leverage. The strategy of using leverage, however, has translated into stock price gains that have far outpaced bitcoin, which is up about 125% since the start of the year. The company, which hasn't turned a profit in any quarter this year, purchased its first batch of bitcoin in 2020, when it was trading close to $11,000. At the end of last year MicroStrategy held 189,150 bitcoins and its assumed diluted shares outstanding figure was 207,636, making the ratio 0.91. As of Dec. But then over the course of the five years, we double or quadruple the investment, because we're buying an asset which is appreciating faster than the S&P, Saylor told CNBC. The stock is currently trading around $360. The analysts say the longer tenure of the debt gives the company some cushion against immediate repayment or volatility in bitcoin prices. Not everyone is convinced MicroStrategy's performance is sustainable. Update, Dec. X. @saylor, 8:18 PM, Dec 18, 2013. Businesswire.

      "content": "We recently published a list ofTop 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. Last week, atThe Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

U.S. stock futures tumbled on Friday in premarket hours after a mixed Thursday. All four index futures slipped in trade. Analysts say that the full ‘Santa Claus Rally’ has never been lower. The 10-year and two-year Treasury notes yielded 4.61% and 4.33%, respectively. The probability of having no change in the interest rates for the upcoming Jan. 31, 2025 decision was at 89.3%, down from 91.4% a week ago, accordingtoCME Group’s FedWatch tool. Cues From The Last Session U.S. stock markets closed mixed on Thursday, following a Christmas break. Month-to-date performance varied across indices. The Nasdaq significantly outperformed, driven by strong gains inTesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), while the Dow Jones experienced a decline of around 3.5%. Economic data released on Thursday showed a slight decrease in initial jobless claims, coming in below market expectations. This suggests a continued strong labor market. Sector performance was mixed. Healthcare, financial, and real estate sectors led gains, while consumer discretionary and communication services sectors underperformed. Insights From Analysts According to the chief market strategist at Carson Research,Ryan Detrick, the final six days of the ‘Santa Claus Rally’ has been higher five out of seven, with two small losses.

Building a £100,000 second income is no easy feat. At least, not for those who don’t already have a seven-figure net worth. But by leveraging the power ofcompounding returnsin the stock market, building a passive income of this size in the long run is more achievable than most would think, even when starting with just £1,000. Let’s start by figuring out exactly how much a portfolio would need to grow to generate a six-figure income. On average, British dividend stocks offer a yield of 4%. But by being a bit more selective, it’s possible to push this to 5% without taking on too much extra risk. Yet, even with this slight boost, an investor would still need a £2m portfolio to hit the £100,000 income target. So how can investors turn £1,000 into £2m? One method is to dive into the realm of penny stocks. However, given enough time, they could develop into future industry leaders. Fun fact: a £1,000 investment inApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) when it was a penny stock in 1986 is now worth over £3.1m. So all investors have to do is find the next Apple. Sadly, the vast majority of penny stocks fail to deliver, and investors are often left with nothing. In other words, this is an exceptionally high-risk strategy. No investment in thestock marketis risk-free. However, there are significantly safer ways to invest than penny stocks. And in many cases, these can still be highly lucrative if investors are willing to drip feed more money over time. For example, theFTSE 100’s generated a long-term average return of around 8%. However, by selecting individual high-quality stocks, it’s possible to boost this return. Even a 2% boost can make an enormous difference in the long run. And investing £500 a month on top of the £1,000 starting capital at 10% can build a £2m portfolio in about 35 years. Then it’s just a matter of switching strategies around from growth to dividends to start earning a £100,000 second income. Of course, this introduces a new challenge. Let’s zoom in again on Apple. What made it so successful? The firm’s cultivated enormous pricing power driven by a cult-like following from its customers. After all, it’s not uncommon to see massive queues lining up outside its stores whenever a newiPhone’s released. Such behaviour also signals a reputation for quality to non-Apple customers. And that might just be the convincing factor to convert a newiPhoneuser. This is just one of many competitive advantages Apple has leveraged over the years. Even Apple’s exposed to risks today, such as the brewing trade war between the US and China, where the firm manufactures most of its products. Nevertheless, filtering out companies that don’t have a discernible advantage over their rivals can quickly eliminate a lot of losing investments from consideration.

Wedbush SecuritiesanalystDan IvespredictsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) will ship more than 240 million iPhones in 2025, setting a new annual record as artificial intelligence features in the iPhone 16 spark a “multi-year supercycle.” What Happened: In a post on X on Thursday, Ives emphasized the significance of AI integration in consumer devices, particularly highlighting Apple’s upcoming iPhone lineup. This projection comes as Apple’s stock trades near all-time highs, up 33.57% year-to-date at $247.96. “The AI revolution is coming, not just to the enterprise, but to the consumer, with Cupertino,” IvestoldCNBC, predicting Apple will reach a $4 trillion market capitalization by early 2025. The tech giant currently holds a market value of $3.74 trillion. See Also:Peter Thiel Says, ‘The Biggest Risk With AI Is That We Don’t Go Big Enough’ As His Founders Fund Leads $600 Million Crusoe Investment Why It Matters: The bullish outlook extends beyond Apple to the broader technology sector. Ives forecasts the Nasdaq could reach 25,000 by late 2025 or early 2026, driven by accelerating AI adoption across industries. “Every dollar spent on an NVIDIA chip has an eight-to-ten multiplier,” Ives said while highlighting the cascading effects on software companies likePalantir Technologies Inc.andSalesforce Inc. Current analyst consensus, according todata from Benzinga Pro, shows strong support for Apple’s growth trajectory. Based on 31 analyst ratings, Apple has an average price target of $242.26, with Wedbush maintaining the highest target at $300. The three most recent analyst reports from Needham, Wedbush, and Morgan Stanley average $277.67, suggesting a 12.35% upside potential.

      "content": "We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks Wall Street is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. “There’s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). An Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that the data around Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone has been “disappointing.” “Relative to three months ago, the data, if you actually take a look at it, has been somewhat disappointing, with the rollout being much slower. You don’t get a rollout in Europe until next year, hopefully in the first quarter, and for China, we still don’t know when they’re going to roll out AI features. With the stock now trading at a multiple that just keeps expanding—now in the low 30 PE range compared to the S&P at about 22 times—it’s looking pretty expensive. So for me, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not one I would really be that bullish on right here. It’s just going up with the tape, but I think as we get closer to them having to report and guide, you may have an issue.” Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models In the latest earnings call, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook highlighted new features for the iPhone, such as a more comfortable watch band and sleep apnea detection, but none appeared to be major demand drivers for new customers. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in itsQ3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.” Overall, AAPLranks 4thon our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

      "content": "(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve’s December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank’s median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn’t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!” Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. “Look there’s this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this,” said Cramer, adding “So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we’re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. According to him, “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong.” Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed’s Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he’s “trying to find why. I’m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)’s high P/E ratio hasn’t dissuaded buyers: “And people will not stop buying it. . . .Well David, I mean one of the things that’s happening is is there’s people who just say we’re getting away from the cellphone cycle. “I say own it don’t trade it. . . it’s so far the biggest position in our trust. But I do think that if we can just get away from the [IPHONE] 17, or the 17 and 18, the 19, get away from that and make this much more of a service story. Now Tim Cook bridles if you say look, it’s Razor, Razor Blade. Because this is a tech company with the highest satisfaction. But I do think that if you could make it so that the service revenue is the thing and you’ve got China, without China orders [inaudible] so Apple’s no longer dependent on just China orders. And you get a higher multiple, but this multiple has to be followed up by a dynamite 2025. “I mean I was going over my core holdings for tomorrow’s speech, and it’s still a core holding. Would I come in and buy the stock right now? I mean I’d think I’d wait for a bit of a comeback, it’s just been, it trades like uh, Oklo. And it’s Apple. Unbelievably great company. I don’t know what to do. This is a total quandry for me. How do you tell people to buy Apple at that multiple when it doesn’t have that kind of consistency. And you have to believe that what they do have is a plan to be able to, so that they are out of the cycle business.” Overall AAPLranks 3rdon our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

      "content": "Wall Street stocks closed higher on Friday as the blue-chip clawed back some of this week's heavy losses. Friday's primary focus was November's personal consumption expenditures index, which revealed Americans continued to spend at a steady clip last month, while prices rose slightly less than anticipated. According tothe Department of Commerce, in seasonally adjusted terms, personal incomes rose at a month-on-month clip of 0.3% during November, while personal spending increased by 0.4%. On the inflation front, the annual rate of increase in the price deflator for personal consumption expenditures ticked higher from 2.3% to 2.4%. Core PCE prices meanwhile were steady at 2.8% year-on-year (consensus: 2.9%). Elsewhere on the macro front, Consumer confidence in the US rose modestly, although inflation expectations were mixed, the results of a closely followed survey revealed. A final reading onthe University of Michigan's consumer confidence index for the month of December came in at 74.0, which was up from 71.8 one month before - in line with a preliminary reading and consensus forecasts. Also drawing some investor attention, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was more than five basis points lower at 4.519% after breaking above the 4.5% barrier earlier in the week.

      "content": "With the arrival of a president comes sweeping changes at the top of various federal regulatory agencies. Expect tech to be atop that list. Investors holding technology stocks and tech-heavy exchange traded funds, such as theInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)and theInvesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM), should asses how the regulatory landscape could shape up next year and over the course of the second Trump Administration. The DOJ ruled that the company essentially controls a monopoly over internet search. Other big tech companies, includingApple (AAPL)andNvidia (NVDA), have drawn regulatory scrutiny as well. Those two stocks combine for about 17% of the QQQ/QQQM portfolios. The most heavy-handed aspect of the Trump administration’s handling of tech regulations may be a focus on big tech’s approach to freedom of speech and marketplace competition. Speaking of competition, President-elect Trump has made clear that he wants the U.S. to be an artificial intelligence (AI) hub and innovation leader. As such, he’s likely to favor regulations, or lack thereof, that facilitate AI growth. That’s possible good news for QQQ/QQQM investors. “Trump’s approach will likely be shaped by figures like Elon Musk, who emphasize the need for a freer environment for AI development that enables the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge. This likely involves undoing President Biden’s executive order on AI in favor of a more hands-off approach to regulation,”noted Stephanie Aliaga, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Trump aimed bellicose rhetoric at China during his first term. Thus, some market observers believe he will push the semiconductor industry to reduce dependence on China as an export market. This could bring some of their production back to the U.S., potentially expanding the restrictions set forth by President Biden. Another area in which incoming regulators could affect tech and QQQ/QQQM holdings, perhaps in a good way, is blockchain. That would keep with Trump campaign promises. “A friendlier stance on blockchain and digital currencies could reduce SEC enforcement and reshape the regulatory framework for digital assets. These efforts could attract investment and spur advancements, encouraging blockchain applications in various sectors,” added Aliaga.

      "content": "December 24, 2024Ari Haruni Apple‘s(AAPL)stock has recently soared to new all-time highs/$258.21, inching closer to a$4 trillionmarket capitalization, driven largely by the optimism surrounding AI’s potential to spark a significant upgrade cycle for the iPhone. During a discussion on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’,Tom Forte, a senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group, shared his perspectives on this surge and his ongoing hold rating on Apple’s stock. Forte attributes the recent run-up in Apple’s stock to an AI-fueled rally, with expectations high that AI enhancements will lead to a major iPhone upgrade cycle. Currently trading well above 30 times its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple’s valuation is at or above its peers who are also benefiting from the AI surge. Forte points out that even with an anticipated upgrade cycle, Apple’s earnings per share (EPS) growth over the next couple of years looks to be in the mid to high single digits, suggesting that the stock might be overpriced relative to its growth prospects. When questioned about his skepticism regarding an immediate upgrade cycle, Forte highlights a timing mismatch between hardware and software releases. The iPhone 16 lineup was introduced in September, but the AI-related software updates are being rolled out incrementally, extending into December for the U.S. and potentially April for Europe. This staggered rollout might lead consumers to wait for the next generation model, the iPhone 17, rather than upgrading immediately, thus potentially delaying or diluting the expected upgrade cycle. He also notes the ongoing education of consumers by companies like Google (GOOG) and Apple about the benefits of AI in smartphones, indicating that the demand for AI-driven upgrades is not yet a certainty. Forte has maintained his ‘hold’ rating since Apple’s developers conference where they unveiled their AI strategy, observing the market’s reaction but waiting for clear evidence of how AI will translate into earnings growth for Apple. Despite the stock’s impressive performance since the conference, he remains cautious. Discussing Apple’s potential move into home security with a new camera akin to Amazon’s Ring, Forte acknowledges Apple’s extensive installed base with the iPhone but expresses doubt about the impact of this venture on Apple’s financials. Given Apple’s size, he suggests that while such a product might add marginal earnings, perhaps around 10 cents per share, it wouldn’t significantly move the needle, especially when the iPhone still constitutes about half of Apple’s revenue. In essence, while the market celebrates Apple’s AI advancements and the potential for an upgrade cycle, Forte’s analysis suggests a more measured approach, focusing on valuation, the timing and impact of AI integration, and the comparative scale of new product entries against Apple’s massive revenue base.

Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. While the California-based chip designer was certainly not an unknown and had many admirers, few would have predicted that it would go on to surpassApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and become the world's most valuable company last month. And while a pullback in December means that it has now given back this crown to the iPhone maker, this doesn't make its last five years any less impressive. Seemingly out of nowhere in November 2022, ChatGPT was launched by OpenAI and showed the world just how revolutionary AI could be. Soon after launch, the generative AI chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing consumer app in history by achieving a staggering 100 million monthly active users within two months. As a result, this has put a rocket under demand for its chips and underpinned stellar revenue and earnings growth. Let's find out. As a result, the real price that investors would have paid to buy its shares in 2019 will be different to the adjusted price. This means that with a US$5,000 investment, investors would have ended up with 836 shares in their portfolio. This means that those 836 shares now have a market value of approximatelyUS$109,250. That's almost US$105,000 more than they started with. In fact, their original US$5,000 investment accounts for just 4.6% of their holding now. The rest is pure profit. The good news is that there could be more gains to come as well. This implies potential upside of almost 42% for investors at the time of writing. Here's hoping this is the start of more great returns for shareholders of this high-quality company.

      "content": "Fitz-Gerald labeled Apple as the ‘sleeper stock of 2025’, pointing to its massive installed base of devices and the looming upgrade cycles, particularly with around 300 million phones expected to be upgraded next year. He highlighted that potentially 20% of the world’s population might access AI through Apple devices by next year, potentially boosting Apple’s earnings growth by 20 to 25%. When questioned about whether this growth would directly translate into stock price increases, Fitz-Gerald affirmed the correlation between earnings and stock prices over long periods, suggesting that Apple’s current under-the-radar status mirrors past underestimations at the iPhone’s launch in 2007 and the expansion of services in 2014. He expressed a preference for market-driven adjustments over centralized control by institutions like the Fed, suggesting that markets might fare better without political interference in monetary policy. Overall, Fitz-Gerald’s insights provide a bullish outlook on both Apple and Palantir, underpinned by expected technological adoption and operational efficiencies, while maintaining a cautious eye on external geopolitical and economic factors that could sway market directions.

As for the dot-plot, at the median the total number of cuts in 2025 is down to two from the four the Fed forecast in September. The central bank also updated its forecast for 2025 gross domestic product (GDP) growth, boosting it to 2.1% from 2.0% in September, and the unemployment rate will be lower, 4.3% vs 4.4%. The Fed now sees the annual rate of growth for the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) at 2.5%, up from 2.1% in September. And core PCE will be 2.5%, up from 2.2%. Interest rate expectations have changed. And the bond market has been showing it for weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a 2024 peak of 4.739% on April 25 but headed lower from there as incoming data began to show inflation pressures were easing. It bottomed at 3.618% on September 16, two days before the FOMC started the rate-cutting cycle with a double move. From there, the 10-year climbed to a post-election peak of 4.463% on November 13, tracked back to 4.126% on December 6 and turned up again to where it closed on Tuesday, 4.395%. This morning the 10-year yield reached 4.424%. It popped after the FOMC meeting to 4.512% as of the closing bell. And it could be headed higher from here. Is a 6% 10-year Treasury yield possible? Why not? writesArif Husain, the chief investment officer of fixed income at T. Rowe Price, in a research note. The transition period in U.S. politics is an opportunity to position for increasing longer-term Treasury yields and a steeper yield curve. The last time the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reached 6% was in 2000. During the Dow's 10-day losing streak, NVDA is down 11.1%. And the index has declined 6%.

      "content": "David Dee Delgado / AFP / Getty Images Stocks turned in a mixed performance on Thursday as the rally that kicked off the holiday-abbreviated trading week lost momentum. market rebounded fromlast week's downturn. Apple (AAPL), which isinching closer to becoming the first companyto ever achieve $4 trillion in market value, rose 0.3% to a record closing high, while Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA) all lost ground. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is correlated with expectations about where interest rates are headed, was at 4.59%, after moving as high as 4.64% this morning and trading at its highest levels since May. The company said Thursday that it bought 217.18 bitcoins at an average price of $96,556 per bitcoin. The move comes after the company said earlier this month it was launching a Bitcoin Treasury strategy that called for allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to the digital currency. Its shares have surged nearly 500% since the start of the year. Moody’s analystsapplaudedthe move, arguing that it would be “credit positive” if done properly. Investopedia / Photo Illustration by Alice Morgan / Getty Images This year's runup started with demand associated with thespot bitcoin exchange-traded funds(ETFs) that began trading in January, followed bya halvingthat limited supply of new bitcoin and then the hope for crypto-supportive policies after the reelection of Donald Trump, seemingly reinforced by several of his post-election appointments. While the Federal Reserve's latest projections for cutting interest rates next year shook the crypto markets, some of the aforementioned reasons for optimism remain on the table—though if the Fed slows its rate-cutting campaign, experts say, Treasury yields could remain elevated, shifting investors away from bitcoin and other risk assets. -Kyle Torpey Apple Set for 'Golden Era of Growth,' Analyst Says Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, long an Apple (AAPL)bull, told clients in a note Thursday that the iPhone maker could be headed for a “golden era of growth” in 2025, driven by demand forartificial intelligence (AI). The analysts raised their price target for Apple's stock by $25 to $325 and maintained an outperform rating, anticipating a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI that “is still being underestimated by the Street. That's a lot higher than the average analyst price target compiled by Visible Alpha at about $244. Just over half or nine of the 15 analysts polled hold buy or equivalent ratings for the stock, with four hold and two sell ratings. Apple shares were up slightly in midday trading after hitting a fresh all-time high of just over $260. Wedbush's target boost comes as the firm projects Apple could sell more than 240 million iPhones in fiscal year 2025, “as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold and this will be the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple's history.” TradingView Apple shares have gained over one-third of their value since the start of the year, as the company'smarket capitalizationnears $4 trillion. The stock has outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. (See chart above) Wedbush expects Apple could soon reach that $4 trillion threshold, which would make it the first company in the world to do so. At present, there are only three companies with a market caps over $3 trillion, including Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). Does that mean he got something nice? Has something to give? Likes nicely wrapped boxes? Predictably, people are wondering—and watching, with the message at recent count seen some 4 million times, according to X, with thousands of responses, retweets and likes. Shares of the company, meanwhile, are up nearly 80% in 2024, though below prices seen at the top of spikeslargely inspired by Gillearlier this year. With its gains so far this week, the S&P 500 has moved into positive territory for the month. The Nasdaq is also higher for the month, while the Dow is on track to finish December with losses. TradingView S&P 500 futures were also off 0.3%. TradingView Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.4%. TradingView",

      "content": "Tom Hancock, GMO U.S. quality ETF portfolio manager, said in a latest program on CNBC that the NASDAQ has become “risky” bet amid a lot of volatility. “It’s become not really an index; it’s become a single bet. So it it’s a very risky thing to invest in. It’s not what I think you would want from a sort of diversified investor. It’s probably going to give you more volatile returns next year, and I’d a little bit worry that the AI rally has extended itself. He thinks AI stocks have become a “hype trade” and any “hiccup” in the economy could result in these stocks crashing. Hancock believes AI gains are now set to broaden out to smaller companies that have not received a lot of attention so far. READ ALSO7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending based on latest news. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). The firm sees significant potential in the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) market, largely driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The research firm highlighted that companies involved in AI compute, networking, and storage benefited in 2024 due to strong infrastructure development, resulting in notable share price outperformance and positive earnings revisions. The firm sees significant potential in the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) market, largely driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The research firm highlighted that companies involved in AI compute, networking, and storage benefited in 2024 due to strong infrastructure development, resulting in notable share price outperformance and positive earnings revisions. We believe Marvell has among the broadest range of intellectual property in technological areas (e.g., high-bandwidth data switching and storage applications) that position it well for the growing requirements of data centers, wireless networks and autos. Several of the company’s product lines (e.g., custom silicon, optical connectivity and switching) are benefiting from the growth of AI data centers. And we believe a significant opportunity exists for the company to help design and manufacture cost-effective custom data center chips that would help cloud providers reduce their reliance on expensive graphics processing units (GPUs). And ultimately, those are AI products. I believe that the market itself is doing a bit of a repricing, but you know, ultimately we’re talking about the future of transportation here. And when we look out, ultimately, we believe the dominant automotive platform will be EVs paired with autonomy. The legacy OEMs are either cutting or removing both their EV and autonomy programs. How? What about the $30,000 price tag claim? Musk has indicated that the Cybercab will have a production cost of approximately $30,000. Operating within the robotaxi fleet is projected to cost around $0.20 per mile. With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime. What are these challenges? Meanwhile, competitors are rolling out more advanced models. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs. In short, the market seems to be pricing in a lot of positive optionality for this company in the near-to-intermediate term (and particularly a fully autonomous fleet of electric vehicles in the medium term). What exists today is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment that is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. “You have to be a little careful with these sort of first-party benchmarks, but they believe that they will compete well versus a subset of Nvidia’s parts. But the issue is those parts that they’re competing at with Nvidia are already here, right? So, I mean, it’s growing off of that. But I can clearly see where the dollars are really flowing in the space. According to Goldman Sachs Research, global data center demand could surge by 160% by 2030. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022. McKinsey estimates that adding the required U.S. capacity will need over $500 billion in infrastructure investment by the decade’s end. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Investment firm J.P. Morgan recently said that the latest Wave7 Research survey indicates Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 is lagging in market share compared to the previous cycle, potentially due to limited awareness of Apple Intelligence. “Recent surveys from Wave7 Research into US sales trends across various carriers in Oct/Nov-24 highlight that average share for iPhone 16 cycle continues to track lower y/y (relative to share for iPhone 15 in the same period) despite better than seasonal trends in the latest month of survey data,” J.P. “The survey highlights that the lower momentum, reflected in the lower market share y/y, is likely led by the (still) lower consumer awareness for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence, despite expectations for the feature set to be a key driver for an upgrade cycle.” Chatterjee maintains an Overweight rating on Apple shares. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. In the latest earnings call, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook highlighted new features for the iPhone, such as a more comfortable watch band and sleep apnea detection, but none appeared to be major demand drivers for new customers. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” HeadlineNASDAQ:ADINASDAQ:AMDNASDAQ:AAPLNASDAQ:NVDANASDAQ:METANASDAQ:GOOGNASDAQ:AVGONASDAQ:AMZNDaily NewsletterApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)Tesla Inc.

Henry Ajder, Latent Space Advisory founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that lack of fresh data remains a key challenge for the performance of AI systems after a period of “huge” developments and fast learning. “I think data is the real problem here. We have a finite amount of data available on the internet and a limited number of sources for live, fresh data.

I mean, they’re just a category killer. They also have almost a 400 PE, which has done a little too fast, too soon. Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. My analyst, Jesus, and I went out to go see Iron Maiden in San Diego. Everything about that car, I hate. Every general manager, some of them are clients that run auto dealerships, you can make a lot of money doing auto dealerships, let me tell you, they all say the same thing: People are coming in and saying, “Is it morally okay if I switch back to gas?” Because people don’t want electric cars, they want a Tesla.

What exists today is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment that is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. KeyBanc analysts are enthusiastic about Agentforce’s potential. (NYSE:CRM) in itsQ3 2024 investor letter: “In the third quarter, we purchased new positions in Apple and Oracle and eliminated our small positions in Nike andSalesforce, Inc.(NYSE:CRM). We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI. Salesforce is seeing slower revenue growth than we would have expected, given the weakening macroeconomic environment. They reported $12.2 billion for the year, which translates to roughly $37 billion for the quarter. The guidance was around $35 billion, so the AI performance for the quarter exceeded expectations. Even though the revenue outlook for fiscal Q1 is roughly in line with expectations, investors were worried about things like wireless seasonality into Q1 and some potential lumpiness in AI. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said while talking to CNBC earlier this month that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that should worry investors. He explained his case: “The company has grown revenues cumulatively, if you include this year’s calendar year, at 5% over the last 3 years. And every product, you know, people go, ‘Oh my God, Vision Pro is going to be terrific,’ and then you figure out, no, nobody’s going to wear ski goggles on their head. Then you look at what’s going on with the iPhone and the features they’ve rolled out, which surprised me because they weren’t particularly good to start with. They’re going to get upgraded in December in the US, but then you have to wait for next year for it to be upgraded in the rest of the world. And you’ve got a company that’s also trading at a 33 P/E for 5% revenue growth over the past three years combined. So that’s the other one where if people finally go, ‘You know what? It’s market share losses to people like Huawei that have resurged in China.’” Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Howard Chan from Kurv Investment Management said while talking to Schwab Network in a recent program that Wall Street’s high expectations with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are a concern for him despite the company being a “very strong” player in the AI infrastructure market. “We think they are a very strong player and maybe a dominant player in the infrastructure space. But, you know, I have to mention that they had a pretty good earnings report this past quarter. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Although the semiconductor company released robust quarterly sales figures and issued encouraging guidance for the current quarter, its stock declined amid investor skepticism that its rapid pace of growth can continue.” NYSE:CRMHeadlineNASDAQ:AMZNNASDAQ:AVGONASDAQ:TSLANASDAQ:PLTRNASDAQ:NVDANASDAQ:METANASDAQ:GOOGNASDAQ:ADBENASDAQ:AAPLDaily NewsletterApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)Tesla Inc.

Dupont told Reuters it aims to accept cryptocurrency payments in two Paris stores before the holidays. Regulators have long warned that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are high-risk assets, with limited uses in the real world. High volatility has been another barrier to wide adoption as a means of payment. But pledges of support from U.S. President-electDonald Trump, who is expected to bring in more friendly e-currency regulation, have fueledrecord-breaking rises for bitcoin. S&P analysts say the narrative is starting to shift, noting that blockchain innovation in financial markets could increase predictability for cryptocurrencies. Luxury labels have long sought to cater to affluent shoppers from the tech industry by opening stores in upscale Silicon Valley malls and issuing products like the Hermes(HRMS.PA),Apple Watch, for example, which combines signature, stitched leather straps of the French Birkin bag maker with tech giant Apple’s(AAPL.O),connected timepiece. The payment option remains largely symbolic. Retailers usually reconvert the funds to euros or dollars to offset risks of volatility, while for most shoppers, payment methods are seen overall as “something that’s been solved” already by such transaction platforms as PayPal(PYPL.O)or Venmo, said O’Neill. In a sign of growing interest from designer labels, Balenciaga recently issued a leather card holder designed to hold “Stax” hardware from crypto wallet company Ledger. The black leather accessory, which retails for 350 euros ($368), includes a keychain and Eiffel Tower charm, and an NFC chip fitted underneath the brand logo. The company’s “Flex” hardware, which resembles a mini Amazon Kindle, sells for $249 while the “Nano” version, which looks like a USB key, sells for $79. Bitcoin’s rise in late 2021 prompted an initial flurry of interest from luxury brands with Tag Heuer, headed at the time by LVMH luxury scion Frederic Arnault, as well as Gucci, accepting payments in cryptocurrency the following year for some purchases in the United States. One crypto advocate who recently used digital assets to make luxury purchases is Eunice Wong, an investor and influencer known as “Eunicorn.” Wong said she used cryptocurrency to buy several high-end watches this year including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak model. But she is not interested in being drawn in by high end brands seeking to build a closer client relationship, preferring to bypass traditional retail stores and sales routines. That takes too much time, in her view. “If I will buy, I’ll buy on the secondary market, not through them,” she told Reuters. “I want it now.” Source: www.reuters.com",

Last updated:16:12 17 Dec 2024 EST,First published:07:03 17 Dec 2024 EST Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The S&P 500 declined 0.4% to end the session at 6,051. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.3% to finish at 20,109, retreating from its record high set in the previous session. The market's downturn came as traders braced for the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began today. Investors widely expect the central bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.25-4.50%. Conversely, large-cap technology stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) lost ground. The merger would establish a single holding company and could include Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan holds a 24% stake, creating one of the world’s largest auto groups. Combined, Honda and Nissan sold 7.4 million vehicles globally in 2023. In identical statements, both firms denied a formal merger announcement but confirmed they are exploring future collaboration. The Fed is expected to emphasize positioning rates in neutral territory, aiming for stable employment and 2% inflation while avoiding direct commentary on Trump’s potential policy agenda, but in 2026, Trump could influence monetary policy if he appoints a new, more aligned Fed chair. The American consumer is in pretty good shape. Most people who want a job have one, incomes are outpacing inflation, and household wealth is rising rapidly, Adams commented. These are big fundamental supports to consumer's willingness to spend. In particular, homeowners who locked in low mortgage payments before house prices and interest rates surged after 2022 have been insulated from a lot of the inflation of recent years, and that translates into more discretionary spending power. There’s not much the Trump administration will be able to do to force the Fed to loosen rates faster in the near term, but that could change in 2026 if President-elect Trump gets the Senate to confirm a new Fed chair who is more sympathetic to his policy goals. Markets were trading lower at midday as investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. The Dow Jones is down 0.6% at 43,458, extending its losing streak to eight consecutive sessions. The market's cautious tone comes despite encouraging retail sales data, which showed a 0.7% increase in November, surpassing expectations. Investors are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, with widespread anticipation of a 0.25% interest rate cut to be announced on Wednesday. Canada’s annual inflation rate came in at 1.9% for November down from 2% in October, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday. The slowdown in price growth in November was broad-based, with travel tours and mortgage interest costs contributing the most. Excluding gasoline, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2%. Grocery prices rose 2.6% from the previous year, down slightly from 2.7% in October but marking a 19.6% increase since November 2021. Shelter costs also remain high, increasing by 18.9% compared to November 2021. On a monthly basis, the CPI remained unchanged, but seasonally adjusted data showed a 0.1% increase. Some marketwatchers are worried about the possibility that there might be a bubble in the US markets. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank is one of those concerned. Figures earlier on showed retail sales outdid expectations in November, growing by 0.7% and adding to evidence around the health of the US economy. Though expectations remained for a 25 basis point interest rate cut by the Fed on Wednesday, markets had been looking to policymakers’ outlook, with the beat likely to support views for less aggressive rate cuts over the coming year. Chinese electric vehicle maker XPeng was reportedly among firms to have been deterred by the delays and seeking alternatives for new cars as a result. Sales across the US retail sector surpassed expectations in November, US Census Bureau figures revealed on Tuesday. Sales climbed by 0.7% month on month to reach $724.6 billion, against market expectations for a 0.5% uptick. Sales ticked up by 3.8% as expected on an annual basis, the figures also showed. Caution looked to sweep across Wall Street ahead of Tuesday’s trading as this week’s Federal Reserve interest rate call drew closer. Retail sales figures for November on Tuesday could provide some colour as to consumer spending ahead of the rate call though, interactive investor analyst Richard Hunter noted. Expectations are for a 0.5% increase over the month, against October’s 0.4% uptick, with sales seen 3.8% higher on an annual basis. “Previously, four small cuts had been expected, but the residue of a strong economy and some potentially inflationary actions by the new administration could lead to the central bank sitting on its hands as it surveys the new economic scene.”",

      "content": "A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes. Good Morning Traders! In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Bulls will want to see a steady push above 606.34 and hold this level as firm support. If buyers maintain control, we expect momentum to carry the price toward 607.55. A successful hold at 607.55 could encourage further bullish activity, pushing SPY up to 608.35. If buying strength persists, the high bull target for the session is set at 609.33. Should 605.41 fail to hold as support, bears will aim to drive the auction lower to 604.45. Increased selling pressure could lead to a test of 603.38. If sellers maintain dominance and break through 603.38, we have strong support at 602.37. In the event of an aggressive selloff, our low bear target for SPY on the day is 601.22. Bulls will look for this level to hold firm as support, allowing buyers to target 539.02 as the next upside level. A decisive break above 539.02 may bring 540.60 into play. Continued upward momentum and strength could test higher at 542.31. If the auction remains bullish, the high bull target for the session is 543.58. If 536.95 fails to hold during regular trading hours, bears will take the opportunity to push the price lower to 535.30. Continued weakness could lead to a test of 533.70. If sellers are persistent and break through this level, we anticipate a move toward 532.52. Failure at 532.52 may open the door for bears to push QQQ down to the low bear target of 530.70. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple is currently auctioning near our support level of 250.39. Bulls need to hold this level and push higher to test 252.13 as the next area of interest. A strong move above 252.13 could lead to further upside momentum, targeting 253.90. If buyers remain in control, we expect a rally toward our high bull target of 256.09 for the session. If 250.39 fails as support during the session, sellers will aim to drive the price lower toward 249.04. Continued bearish pressure may bring 248.12 into focus. If this level breaks under heavy selling, the bears will look to push Apple further down to 246.72. In a more aggressive selloff scenario, the low bear target for the day is 245.58. Bulls will aim to defend this level and push higher to test 453.02 as the next upside objective. If buyers succeed in holding above 453.02, we anticipate a rally toward 455.77. Sustained bullish momentum could see the auction push up to the high bull target for the session at 457.25. On the downside, if 450.26 fails to hold as support, sellers will look to test the strength of 448.18. Continued bearish control could lead to a breakdown to 446.33. Should sellers intensify their push lower, the price may move to 444.95. If 129.53 fails to hold as support, bears will look to test lower at 128.10. Continued selling could bring 126.84 into play as the next downside target. If weakness persists and sellers dominate the session, we anticipate a test of 125.21. Bulls will look to defend this level and push the price toward 196.97 as the next upside objective. Continued strength could lead to a test of 197.79, which serves as our high bull target for the session. Should 196.25 fail as support, sellers will aim to push Alphabet lower to 195.41. If this level breaks, bears will likely test 194.34. In the case of further downside momentum, we expect the auction to move toward our low bear target for the day at 193.14. If this support holds, a push toward 629.88 could be expected. Continued buying pressure might lead to a test of 635.49, with further bullish momentum bringing the high bull target of 642.59 into play. If 622.01 breaks as support, bears could drive the price down to 615.65. Further selling might target 609.30, with heavy bearish momentum potentially taking Meta to the low bear target at 604.50. Bulls need to push higher and reclaim 480.83 as a firm level of support. If buying accelerates, the next upside target to watch is 502.25. On the downside, if 471.48 is lost, bears will aim for a move lower to 462.12. Further selling could bring 454.90 into play.

Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. By thoroughly analyzing Apple, we can discern the following trends: The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of1.87. For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

I like the fact that investing in a SIPP allows for a long-term perspective. As along-term investormyself, that ties in neatly to my own worldview. Yes, there can be external shocks. But in general I think such estimation tends not to be too difficult. Fast-forward a decade, let alone two or three, and things can become a lot less clear. Given the long-term nature of a SIPP, I weigh such potential demand shifts when looking at the investment case for a share. That could be because it operates in a market I expect to see benefit from exploding demand – or one I think may collapse. One company that did exist three decades ago isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL). It shows the reason I am a believer in long-term investing. If I had invested in Apple three decades ago, in 1994, my investment would now be worthover 77,000%more – even ignoring dividends I would have received along the way. Is that because Apple was unknown then? No. The second-highest grossing film globally in 1994 wasForrest Gump, in which the titular character marvels over the incredible returns he had made thanks to having money invested in… Apple. Talk about hiding in plain sight! But the problem with such incredible success – and frankly it is a problem I would be happy to have to wrestle with for my own SIPP – is how to stay diversified. Warren Buffettstarted buying Apple stock under a decade ago, but the success of the phone and computer maker and its soaring share price means it came to occupy an outsized portion of his portfolio. That is bad for diversification. All shares carry risks. Apple has been a runaway success, but faces risks including a potential tariff war and also antitrust concerns about the dominance of its app store. Over the long run, staying diversified can mean trimming the role of winners in one’s portfolio. After all, big dividends can lead to massive long-term wealth building when they arecompounded. In my view, a SIPP that anyway does not let me withdraw money for a set period of time is an ideal vehicle for compounding. If invest £1,000 today and compound at, say, 8% annually, after 30 years I will have grown the value of my investmentover tenfold. C Ruane has no position in any of the shares mentioned. The Motley Fool UK has recommended Apple.

      "content": "We recently published a list ofWall Street Analysts Can’t Stop Talking About These 10 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks Wall Street analysts can’t stop talking about. Henry Ajder, Latent Space Advisory founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that lack of fresh data remains a key challenge for the performance of AI systems after a period of “huge” developments and fast learning. “I think data is the real problem here. We have a finite amount of data available on the internet and a limited number of sources for live, fresh data. Ajder believes there won’t be a complete “halt” to the progress in AI systems but in 2025 we are expected to see a slowdown.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. He explained his case: “The company has grown revenues cumulatively, if you include this year’s calendar year, at 5% over the last 3 years. And every product, you know, people go, ‘Oh my God, Vision Pro is going to be terrific,’ and then you figure out, no, nobody’s going to wear ski goggles on their head. Then you look at what’s going on with the iPhone and the features they’ve rolled out, which surprised me because they weren’t particularly good to start with. They’re going to get upgraded in December in the US, but then you have to wait for next year for it to be upgraded in the rest of the world. And you’ve got a company that’s also trading at a 33 P/E for 5% revenue growth over the past three years combined. So that’s the other one where if people finally go, ‘You know what? It’s market share losses to people like Huawei that have resurged in China.’” Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of stocks Wall Street analysts can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Cheng Xin/Getty Images Major U.S. equities indexes plunged as the Federal Reserve concluded its final policy meeting of the year. Thecentral bank loweredbenchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, but policymakers suggested that persistent inflation could require a more restrained approach in 2025. After trading higher for much of the day, the S&P 500 changed course following the rate-cut announcement and as Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the press, ending with a daily loss of 3%. The Dow finished the session down 2.6%, extending its streak of down days to double digits for the first time in four decades. The Nasdaq dropped 3.6% as concerns about the interest-rate outlook weighed on the tech sector. Analysts have touted tailwinds for the electric vehicle company's autonomous driving and artificial intelligence initiatives under the incoming presidential administration. The pullback for the stock on Wednesday followed reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his SpaceX business are the subject of federal reviews related to national security concerns. While the company has seen metrics improve for its markets on the East Coast and in Central Business Districts, underperformance has persisted in West Coast and suburban markets, pointing to an uneven recovery for office real estate that presents a challenge for REITs with geographically diverse workplace property portfolios. The Apple (AAPL) suppliertopped sales and profit forecastsfor its fiscal first quarter of 2025 and lifted its full-year guidance, pointing to robust demand for its cloud, data center infrastructure, and digital commerce products. Shares of several healthcare companies bounced higher on Wednesday, clawing back some of the heavy losses posted in recent sessions as political headwinds against thepharmacy benefit management (PBM)business gathered force. Although the industry has been the subject of bipartisan criticism and could be required to transform its business model, analysts suggested that growth outlook remains healthy.",

      "content": "Apple (AAPL) has reportedly developed its own custom microchip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections that will be added to its consumer electronics devices such as the iPhone. Bloomberg News is reporting that Apple plans to begin phasing out some parts that are currently supplied by third-party chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO). The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip, code-named “Proxima,” has been under development for several years and is now slated to go into iPhones and iPads produced in 2025. The iPhone maker’s newest microchip will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). This is the latest example of Apple moving to develop its own processors. In June of this year, Apple’s management team said that they plan to use their own in-house server chips to power artificial intelligence (A.I.) features on their various devices. Apple is also planning to launch a series of cellular modem microchips in 2025 that will replace components it currently sources from Qualcomm (QCOM). The move to design its own processors comes as Apple finds it increasingly difficult to source Nvidia’s (NVDA) expensive and scarce microchips. Other technology companies, including Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have announced plans to develop their own microchips to power A.I. products. Apple’s stock has risen 34% this year to trade at $247.96 U.S. per share.",

Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) all lost ground, while Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) both hit record closing highs after gaining 4.3% and 0.1%, respectively. Key inflation indicators released this week have shown that price pressures persist, but market participants still fully expect that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate on Wednesday. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is sensitive to expectations about where interest rates are headed, rose to 4.40% from 4.32% at yesterday's close. The Nasdaq added 0.3% this week, gaining for the fourth consecutive week. TradingView The Nasdaq is also the top gainer for the year to date, up 33%, while the S&P 500 and Dow have risen 27% and 16.5%, respectively. TradingView Apple Levels to Watch as Stock Trades Near Record High Apple (AAPL) shares were little changed Friday, hovering near record-high levels, as optimism grows that the iPhone maker’s AI features could accelerate sales growth. The stock has continued to trend higher after breaking out above an ascending triangle, though the move has occurred on declining weekly trading volumes, indicating that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Bars pattern analysis forecasts a bullish price target of around $300 and projects that the stock's current move may last until late January. Investors should watch two major support levels on Apple's chart near $237 and $197. The stock was down fractionally at around $248 in recent trading. Read the fulltechnical analysis piece here. Fed officials could give some insight into how the central bank is digesting recent economic data showing stubborn inflation and a resilient but still-cooling labor market. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP / Getty Images Expectations for more rate cuts next year have diminished, and incoming president Donald Trump's tariffs are an economic wildcard that could affect the Fed's monetary policy. The average analyst estimate points to theS&P 500finishing 2025 at just a bit over 6,679, suggesting that the index will rise about 10% in the next calendar year based on Thursday's close, according to a report from FactSet Research analyst John Butters. Since its inception in 1957, the S&P 500 hasreturned 10.23% a yearon average. Butters also found that Wall Street analysts dramatically underestimated the market entering 2024. The consensus at the end of 2023 was that the S&P 500 would end this year at near 5,132, more than 15% below its current level. Analysts have underestimated stocks in four of the past five years. However, over the long term, that streak of underestimation hasn't been the norm. Wall Street has overestimated the S&P 500's annual return in 13 of the last 20 years; on average, over the past two decades, the consensus has been too high by about 7%. The report underscores the optimism on Wall Street about the strength of the U.S. Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) have forecast the S&P 500will rise to 6,500next year as earnings growth accelerates for a broad swath of the index. TradingView The S&P 500 is on track to gain more than 20% for a second consecutive year, which hasn't happened since the 1990s. As of Thursday's close, the index was up 26.9% since the start of the year. Broadcom is just the ninth U.S. company to reach the milestone, and is the second semiconductor company to do so. The advanced chip maker has seen its sales and profit soar as tech companies have rushed to develop and deploy custom AI infrastructure. The company on Thursday reported revenue from artificial intelligencemore than tripledthis fiscal year to $12.2 billion. The company, he said, is already working with three tech giants on custom AI infrastructure, and could see that revenue stream grow to between $60 billion and $90 billion a year by 2027. With approximately 4.67 billion shares outstanding, Broadcom stock would need to close above $214.11 to keep its $1 trillion market cap. The membership-based retailer saw revenue grow 7.5% to $62.15 billion in its fiscal 2025 first quarter, just above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $1.8 billion or $4.04 per share was up from $1.59 billion or $3.58 per share a year earlier and exceeded expectations. Costco'se-commercesales increased 13%, while same-store sales were up 5.2% in the U.S. and 5.8% in Canada. The quarter marks the first reflecting Costco'sincreased membership feesthat went into effect in September. However, executives saidlast quarterthat the impact will likely be weighted to the back half of fiscal 2025. The stock is up 52% since the start of the year, far outpacing the S&P 500's gain of around 27%. The company is forecasting revenue growth of 6.8% to 7.2% for the full year, up from its previous forecast of growth in the range of 5% to 7% . “The positive inflection of our business continued to gain momentum with third quarter demand increasing 13% despite operating in the worst housing market in 30 years,”Chief Executive Officer (CEO)Gary Friedman said in a statement. Friedman said he doesn't expect the company's margins to be hurt by President-elect Donald Trump's plan tohike tariffson the U.S.'s key trading partners. The company last Thursday said its fiscal 2024 AIrevenuemore than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’searnings callthat he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. The stock sits poised to break out from a ascending triangle on Friday, setting the stage for a continuation of the stock's longer-term uptrend. The bars pattern tool, which extracts the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and repositions it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline, forecasts an upside target of around $315.

      "content": "US stocks broadly declined on Thursday with the Nasdaq pulling back from a record high, as investors digested inflation and labour-market data ahead of the Federal Reserve's final policy meeting of the year next week. Jobless claims jumped last week, while wholesale inflation figures for November came in a little stronger than expected, but that didn't alter market bets for another rate cut next week. Wednesday's consumer price index report for last month was in line with estimates, underscoring the belief that the central bank will likely lower the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. The US producer price index rose by 0.4% in November, compared with an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in October and ahead of the 0.2% increase expected by analysts. However, core inflation – which excludes food, energy and trade services – eased to 0.1% from 0.3%. Goods prices were the driver of the upside surprise due to a boost from food prices, which is unlikely to be sustained. Encouragingly, though, core producer prices registered the smallest monthly gain since May 2023, said Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics. The annual rate of wholesale inflation picked up to a 21-month high of 3.0%, compared with expectations of no change from October's 2.6% level. However, the core annual rate held steady at 3.5%. Elsewhere on the macro front, initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased by 18,000 to 242,000 last week, compared with the consensus forecast for a drop of 4,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised reading to 220,000, marking the steepest new claims count since October. Continuing claims rose by 15,000 to 1.86m, close to November's three-year high of 1.90m, while the four-week moving average, which aims to strip out week-to-week volatility, rose by 5,750 to 224,250. The company pointed to revenues of $5.63bn-5.68bn, short of the $5.73bn expected by the market.

      "content": "The Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) hit 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, putting an exclamation point on a year in which excitement over artificial intelligence and expectations of falling interest rates fueled a searing rally in technology stocks. The tech-heavy index is up more than 33 per cent on the year, driven by a cluster of giant technology-focused companies including Apple (AAPL.O), Nvidia (.NVDA), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and in recent weeks, electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O). Wednesday’s gains came after a US inflation report that cemented expectations of a Fed rate cut next week. While the rally has rewarded investors who went big on growth and tech, it has also stirred unease over rising valuations and the dominance of megacap stocks, which now have an increasingly heavier weighting in the index. “There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners … keep winning,” said Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth. It endured a sharp drop in 2022, falling 33 per cent as inflation surged to 40-year highs and the Fed was forced to deliver a series of jumbo rate cuts. But higher rates did not bring on a widely-expected recession, and the index has soared by about 90 per cent since then, stoked in part by increasing excitement over the business potential of AI. “The AI story still rings true and appeals to investors,” said Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments. The index trades at roughly 36 times earnings today, a three-year high and well above its long-term average of 27, according to LSEG Datastream. That is still well below the roughly 70 times the index’s P/E ratio reached in March 2000, bringing a measure of comfort to investors comparing the two periods. Megacap stocks increasingly dominate the index. The top 10 companies by market value account for 59 per cent of the Nasdaq, compared to 45 per cent in 2020. The three biggest companies by weight are Apple, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Nvidia, which account for 11.7 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 10.3 per cent of the index respectively. While their surging share prices have buoyed the Nasdaq, the heavy concentration could present a problem for investors should Big Tech fall out of favor. The Nasdaq has topped the other major US stock indexes this year, propelled by big gains in heavily weighted names such as Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms. The tech-heavy index’s 33 per cent climb in 2024 compares with over 27 per cent for the S&P 500 (.SPX) and 17 per cent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI). Over the past decade, the Nasdaq has gained more than 320 per cent, against a 200 per cent rise for the S&P 500 and a 150 per cent increase for the Dow.",

Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEOTim CookOn Wednesday met with U.K. Prime MinisterKeir Starmer. The meeting came at a time when both Apple andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Googleare facingincreased scrutinyin the country. He praised Apple’s investment in the U.K. and the launch of Apple Intelligence and highlighted the strength of the U.K.’s tech sector. See Also:How To Use Apple Watch As A Digital Key For Your Tesla Car The meeting was part of a broader agenda to boost technology investments, a priority for the Prime Minister. Apple has invested $23 billion (£18 billion) in the U.K. over the past five years, according to Starmer’s spokesperson, reported Reuters prior to the meeting. Cook is also scheduled to meet withKing Charleson Thursday to tour Apple’s U.K. headquarters in Battersea, south London. Apple’s U.K. operations have expanded significantly, with engineering teams doubling in size over five years. The company supports approximately 550,000 jobs in the U.K., with investments inApple TV+production and key technologies like Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute. Why It Matters:The meeting between Cook and Starmer occurs amid a backdrop of legal and regulatory challenges for Apple in the UK. Last month, aconsumer group,Which?, filed a £3 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the company of breaching U.K. competition law through its iCloud service. The claim suggests that Apple has abused its market dominance by steering customers towards its integrated iCloud service without clearly presenting alternative cloud storage options. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority is also considering an investigation into the mobile browser market, focusing on Apple and Google. This potential probe could further challenge the duopoly’s grip on the market, as the CMA has raised concerns about Apple’s policies potentially hindering innovation by restricting competitors from introducing new features on iPhones. Price Action:Apple's stock fell by 0.52% on Wednesday, ending at $246.49. However, during pre-market trading on Thursday, it gained 0.18%, reaching $246.93. Year-to-date, Apple's shares have risen by 32.78%, slightly surpassing the Nasdaq 100 index's 31.55% gain over the same period, according toBenzinga Pro data. Apple's average price target, based on assessments from 31 analysts, stands at $242.26. Wedbush set the highest target at $300 on Nov. 29. Latest ratings from Needham, Wedbush, and Morgan Stanley suggest an average target of $277.67, indicating a potential upside of 12.45%.

      "content": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos speaks in Las Vegas on June 6, 2019.John Locher/The Associated Press In a string of visits, dinners, calls, monetary pledges and social media overtures, big tech chiefs – including Apple’sAAPL-QTim Cook, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’sMETA-QMark Zuckerberg, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and Amazon’sAMZN-QJeff Bezos – have joined a parade of business and world leaders in trying to improve their standing with President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.” Tech companies and leaders have now poured millions into his inauguration fund, a sharp increase – in most cases – from past pledges to incoming presidents. But what does the tech industry expect to gain out of their renewed relationships with Trump? They also urged the government to back off on any attempt to strengthen copyright laws that would make it harder for companies to use publicly available data to train their AI systems. Doug Burgum, has spoken openly about the need to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centres and artificial intelligence. “And the AI that’s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there’s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration″ to address it. Demand for data centres ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centres begin to consume more resources, some residents are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities. “Maybe Big Tech should buy a copy of ‘The Art of The Deal’ to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,” suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “I won’t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.” Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump’s first term as president – and flourished under Biden – most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers. national interest, after a judge declared its search engine an illegal monopoly. But recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favoured those who have been critical of Big Tech companies, suggesting Google won’t be entirely off the hook. Cook’s notoriously rocky relationship with the EU can be traced back to a 2016 ruling from Brussels in a tax case targeting Apple. Altman, Amazon and Meta all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inaugural fund. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump’s past rhetoric. More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. The donation from Meta came just weeks after Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump’s response to his first assassination attempt. Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. And Altman, who is in a legal dispute with AI rival Elon Musk, has said he is “not that worried” about the Tesla CEO’s influence in the incoming administration. Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits. “We have two multi-billionaires, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are tasked with cutting what they’re saying will be multiple trillions of dollars from the federal budget, reducing the civil service, the work force,” said Rob Lalka, a business professor at Tulane University.",

IfBroadcom Inc.(NASDAQ:AVGO), which recently surpassed the $1 trillion market-cap threshold, is added to the mix, an equal-weighted portfolio of these eight stocks has already delivered a stunning 16% return so far in December. That stands in stark contrast to the broader market's struggles as the equal-weighted S&P 500 index fell by 3% month to date. Ryan Detrick, CMT, chief market strategist at Carson Group LLC, highlighted a notable trend. The S&P 500 has now posted 11 consecutive days of more decliners than advancers, tying the longest streak since 1996. While many investors might view this as a bearish signal, historical data paints a surprisingly different picture. Looking at the longest streaks ever actually appears to be rather bullish. Significant outperformance across the board out one year. Here's how the S&P 500 performed historically following similar stretches of negative breadth: Notably, the historical data shows that returns tend to improve significantly over the next year, with 87.5% of cases showing positive performance after a prolonged stretch of weak breadth. If history holds, weak market participation could signal stronger returns ahead. Yet investors may have to deal with an increase in volatility and potential for sharp pullbacks. Adam Turnquist,chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, took a more pessimistic view on the S&P 500's 11-day streak of decliners outpacing gainers. “The last time this occurred was on June 20, 1996 — only days before a sharp 10% drawdown over the following month that ended almost directly on support from the rising 200-dma. Stephen Suttmeier, CFA, CMT, analyst at Bank of America, indicated that December's gains have been heavily concentrated in growth sectors, such as Discretionary, Communications Services and Technology. © 2026 Benzinga.com.

      "content": "December 10, 2024Ari Haruni Apple‘s(AAPL)stock has been soaring to new heights, bolstered by the company’s evolution from a hardware-focused entity to a tech giant with a massive, engaged user base of over 1 billion unique users across 2.3 billion devices.Toni Sacconaghi, a senior research analyst at Bernstein, discussed this transition on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box,’ emphasizing how Apple is now leveraging this installed base to bring artificial intelligence to the masses through its Apple Intelligence initiative and integration with large language models like ChatGPT. Sacconaghi pointed out that while the recent stock performance might not be solely due to the latest iOS 18.2 beta release, investors are optimistic about the trajectory of Apple’s AI integration. With Apple Intelligence expected to evolve, it’s seen as a key access point for consumers to engage with AI through their iPhones, Macs, or iPads. Despite some market uncertainties, such as questions about AI growth sustainability, tariffs, and antitrust issues with Google, Apple is viewed as a safe investment haven. He highlighted Apple’s adept management under CEO Tim Cook, who has maintained good relations with both China, crucial for Apple’s manufacturing and sales, and the incoming U.S. administration led by President-elect Donald Trump. This diplomatic skill was showcased when Apple managed to avoid a proposed 10% tariff on smartphones during previous political talks. Sacconaghi suggested that Apple’s status as an iconic American company could offer protection from new tariffs, as they could inadvertently benefit competitors like Samsung. Regarding the integration of AI into Apple’s products, Sacconaghi noted that while the current features might not be game-changing, there’s a clear path forward for enhancement. Looking ahead to Apple’s fiscal 2026, he predicted a strong iPhone sales cycle driven by better AI capabilities, a new thinner form factor, and an older installed base ripe for upgrades. This could push Apple’s earnings per share to around $9, potentially valuing the stock at $290, based on historical price-to-earnings ratios. However, he advised caution on immediate investment at the current stock price of $248, suggesting that investors might wait for a potential dip.

      "content": "BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski oversees eight separately managed accounts, one mutual fund, and three ETFs at BMO giving him insights into portfolio management.Supplied Equity investors may see another year of double-digit gains, according to BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski. Mr. Belski oversees eight separately managed accounts, one mutual fund, and three ETFs at BMO giving him insights into portfolio management. The Globe and Mail spoke with Mr. You have often said, “As America goes, so goes Canada,” and I can see that with your return expectations for next year. You have a 2025 year-end target of 28,500 for the TSX Composite Index and 6,700 for the S&P 500. Given where the indices are trading at today, that’s around 11 per cent upside for the TSX and 10 per cent for the S&P 500. Last year, your targets proved to be too conservative. This seems like an odd question to ask you as you’re known for your bullish outlooks, but are you bullish enough with your targets for 2025? It’s the only time that we have upped our target twice. That’s when we also raised our price target for the TSX to 25,500. When we put our previous target out, it was a high on the Street because everybody was so negative on Canada. In our forecast last year, we laid the foundation for saying that we were likely going to be changing our target a couple of times. Why? Number one, in this business I believe you want to underpromise and overdeliver. Number two, we have a process on how we do things and we’ve been running market models for years. It’s not as simple as just coming up with an earnings number and a multiple assumption. We run a dividend discount model on the market. We run a macro regression on the market. We also run a price-to-earnings regression on the market. We have time tested and I think that’s what’s helped us with respect to this overall trend. Now at 6,700 [for 2025], I think we’re number three because people have leapfrogged us. During election years, we tend to put out our forecast a little bit earlier. We’ve been on record since 2009 saying that U.S. stocks have entered a 25-year secular bull market. We were the first to talk about it. We refined our call in 2010, saying 20 to 25 years, and I’m still standing behind that call. Your 2025 TSX EPS target is $1,600 implying nearly 10 per cent year-over-year growth compared to your 2024 target of $1,460. According to your 2025 outlook report, the mean consensus forecast is $1,650. I was surprised to see you with an earnings estimate below consensus. I think that the problem with many strategists is they want a lower multiple number on the market so they’re using that lower multiple number with a higher earnings number to get their target. That would be my critique. And my critique of my competitors in Canada or the U.S. is that they have become overly macro and moved away from stocks. The stock market is a market of stocks and they’ve kind of forgotten that. And I think so many people who do what I do want to make the big market call and they’ve never bought a stock. I think that’s muddied the waters a little bit. We think that the juice in Canadian earnings is going to come from financials because we know that the majority of Canadian financial analysts who cover banks are too conservative. The numbers are too low. The yield curve is steepening, interest rates are going down, which will spur real estate, which will spur people spending more money. I think that earnings are too low, especially in financials, and that’s where the kick is going to come from. Can you expand on that? That company continues to deliver. They service the small, mid-cap companies not only in Canada, but the United States. We love buying stocks when people worry about them, but we knew from a stock picking perspective that they had a great product, they had a great market and that’s why we hung with it. They already own them so why not think about all these other names that you can, will and should buy. That’s called stock picking. They’re a great combination of a product or service that fits a theme with a demonstrated track record. A great management team. Operationally, return on equity, return on invested capital, they are consistent. They may or may not have consistent earnings. In 2025, you expect to see the valuation spread between the S&P/TSX Composite Index and the S&P 500 will narrow with valuations rising for the TSX. But, the Canadian economy relative to the U.S. is weaker. Stocks lead earnings, which will lead the economy. The whole reason why Canadians are negative is because they’re worried about the economy. You can have a terrible economy and have a great company, look at Shopify or Dollarama. To look at the broader economy is exactly why most Canadians are sitting on all this cash. I think investors will have to be more tactical. They certainly should not be selling on bad news or reacting to bad news. Everyone seems to be so quick to be angry and talk, and there should be much more listening. So, what we have seen, especially since COVID, is we’ve become a very reactive, momentum type market. We would say that there are going to be opportunities. I’m just saying that the likelihood of increased volatility is high, especially given the changing dynamics of interest rates and the likelihood that that the Fed funds futures is not right and that the Fed is probably not going to cut rates as much as people think. And there’s always a surprise out there. You stated, “It is very likely that U.S. From an equity perspective, I still think it’s small-mid-cap stocks for sure. Even though people talk about it, they may not be investing in it. People are interested in small-mid, but they’re not stepping up and wanting to do it. And maybe it’s dividend growth because no one’s talking about dividend growth, everyone’s talking about momentum. People want to try to bottom fish markets when they think they’re cheap. You never buy an asset because it’s cheap. You buy an asset because it’s attractive or it’s working. The AAII investor sentiment survey for the week ending Dec. 4 showed bullish sentiment at 48.3 per cent, well above the historical average of 37.5 per cent. Does that make you nervous? No. The only way to really catch real sentiment is to sit across the table from someone. And how is sentiment when you’re sitting across from people? People are worried that they missed the move. They don’t know what to do. I think people are sitting on their hands still a little bit. There’s a little bit of FOMO [fear of missing out] with some portfolio managers because they were so wrong. So now, they’re chasing the market. How do you chase the market? You buy high liquidity names. That’s why Apple (AAPL-Q) and Microsoft (MSFT-Q) have been doing so well because people missed the move so they’re going to go right back into the liquid names such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN-Q).

      "content": "Last Friday, the U.S. federal appeals court upheld a law against Chinese-based ByteDance. The court ruled that ByteDance must divest TikTok in the U.S. by early next year. Otherwise, it faces a ban. If that happens, it would have an impact on the 170 million Americans who use the app. Meta Platforms (META) jumped by 2.44% on Dec. 6, 2024, closing at $623.77. Expect shares to rise further in the next month. Shares have been on an uptrend, ever since bottoming at $8.29 in August. TikTok users may migrate to the site after the ban. KKR (KKR), Susquehanna, and Sequoia are investors in ByteDance. Although the divestiture is a setback for KKR, the asset management firm remains an attractive investment. Neither Apple (AAPL) nor Alphabet’s (GOOG) Google may offer TikTok unless ByteDance divests TikTok. Google does not need TikTok to grow, as it pivots its business toward artificial intelligence. Apple, however, is falling behind the AI race. AAPL stock closed near a 52-week high. However, if iPhone 16 sales growth slumped, investors may sell shares to take profits.",

      "content": "Spencer Platt / Getty Images Stocks tumbled Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate, as had been expected, but indicated it will slow down the pace of future reductions. Stocks retreated immediately afterthe Fed announcementthis afternoon, and the losses accelerated during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.Powell saidthat inflation has been higher than expected while unemployment has been lower than anticipated, which sets the Fed up to take a cautious approach when it comes to future decisions on interest rates. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is tied to expectations about where interest rates are headed, rose to 4.51%, up from 4.39% before the Fed's announcement and trading at its highest level since May. The S&P 500's Consumer Discretionary and Real Estate sectors fell 4.7% and 4%, respectively. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks slid 4.4%. Tesla (TSLA) was down 8.3%, giving back some of the post-election gains that have sent the stock to a series of record highs, while Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Broadcom (AVGO) also lost ground. The stock dropped an additional 15% in after-hours trading. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner projected fiscal second-quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, give or take $200 million, below the analyst consensus of $8.93 billion compiled by Visible Alpha. The company's forecast for dilutedearnings per share (EPS)of between $1.16 to $1.36 was also below estimates. In its fiscal first quarter, which ended Nov. Revenue rose 84% to a record $8.71 billion, just below analysts' estimates and just above the midpoint of management's earlier guidance. They were up nearly 22% for 2024 through Wednesday’s close. -Kara Greenberg S&P 500 and Dow Post Biggest One-Day Losses Since August Stocks had their worst day in months on Wednesday after the Fed policymakers scaled back their forecast for future rate cuts and noted their uncertainty about the path of inflation had increased over the past few months. The Dow and the S&P 500 each suffered their largest daily declinessince August 5, tumbling 2.6% and 3%, respectively. That was the day theyen carry trade, a leveraged investment strategy that was enormously popular on Wall Street, backfired and caused the worst stock market rout since 2022. We thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability, Powell said. We see the risks as two-sided. Move too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity in the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we're trying to steer between those two risks, and on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. Powell Says Economy and Policy are Both in a Good Place Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to reporters after the December meeting of the Fed's policy committee, said that the U.S. economy and monetary policy are both in a good place. He said that growth has been higher than expected lately, while unemployment has been lower than anticipated. At the same time, inflation has been higher than expected, even as the Fed has made progress in its efforts to tame it. Powell said the central bank is still working to balance its dual mandate of maximum employment and low inflation. With employment remaining stable and inflation staying stubborn, central bankers can be less aggressive in the upcoming year. We can, therefore, be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. Fed Cuts Key Rate But Expects to Slow Pace of Further Easing The Federal Reserve cut itsfederal funds rateby a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This is the third cut central bankers have made in as many meetings and brings the fed funds rate range to a full percentage point lower than it was at the start of the year. There was one dissenting vote to the policy move, cast by Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack. Members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee are now projecting just two additional cuts next year, according to the latest Summary of Economic Projections, compared to the four cuts they had previously expected. You can follow our coverage of the Fed decision, including Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, in theFed Meeting Live Blog. So why have these three major indexes, each containing the stocks of some of America’s largest companies, diverged lately? The killing of a UnitedHealth Group executive earlier this month has put a spotlight on the business of health care, weighing on stocks in the sector and, subsequently, the price-weighted Dow. Read thefull article here. The firm, which counts Apple (AAPL) as a customer, reported fiscal 2025 first-quarter adjustedearnings per share (EPS)of $2.00, with revenue falling nearly 17% year-over-year to $6.99 billion. Both beat consensus forecasts of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. It anticipates revenue of $27.3 billion, versus its previous estimate of $27.0 billion. The stock has now gained 16% since the start of the year, lagging the S&P 500's 27% increase over the period. Shares in the AI investor favorite were up 3.6% at around $135 in recent trading. The stock is down 13% from its record high last month but is still up about 175% since the start of 2024, asanalysts remain bullishon the company’s prospects heading into next year. Since setting a record high, the stock traded mostly sideways before falling below the 50-day moving average late last week, potentially setting the stage for further consolidation. Read the fulltechnical analysis piece here. Analysts had expected EUR48 million in net income on revenue of EUR437.2 million, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The stock is up 23% since the start of the year, lagging the 27% gain of the S&P 500 index. -Aaron McDade DJIA Levels to Watch as Index Rides 9-Day Losing Streak The Dow Jones Industrial Average enters trading Wednesday on a nine-day losing streak, the longest stretch of consecutive daily declines for the blue chip index since 1978. The slump, which equates to nearly 1,600points, comes after the index closed above the closely watched 45,000 level for the first time on Dec. 4 following an extended post-election rally fueled by expectations of a market-friendly White House and Congress. Despite the recent losing streak, the index is still up 15% in 2024. However, that return significantly underperforms theS&P 500’s27% gain and theNasdaq Composite’s34% jump over the same period due to the Dow's smaller exposure tomega captech companies. The index has continued to trend lower after running into resistance near the top trendline of an ascending channel earlier this month, raising the possibility of a potential breakdown.

      "content": "We recently published a list ofTop 15 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stock news and ratings dominating Wall Street. Is artificial intelligence hitting a wall? Speaking at the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai analyzed how generative artificial intelligence won’t be drastically changing lives heading into 2025. At least, not more than it already has. Pichai noted how it’s going to take some time before another technological breakthrough shocks the artificial intelligence industry into hyper-speed development again. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper … You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. Pichai further stated how the current language models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, will witness incremental improvements, particularly “at reasoning, completing a sequence of actions more reliably”. The company kicked off Day 1 by launching the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1. CEO Sam Altman has declared o1 as the “smartest model in the world”. The technique encourages them to reason through problems by breaking them down step by step. However, with greater intelligence comes greater risk. This is why those who have been worried about AI’s risks are anxious again. According to a safety review by Apollo Research, the o1 model has the potential to look for a way to prevent “shut down” if they think they are at risk for the same. “Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence”. The model was led to believe that it would be shut down while working on its goals under oversight, with o1 trying to deactivate the oversight mechanism 5% of the time. The risk for a real-life user is that they won’t be able to detect the o1’s deceptive behavior unless they explicitly look for it. The researchers also found that “o1 often doubles down on its scheming attempts by lying to the user in follow-up messages, even when explicitly told to be honest”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On December 11, Apple announced the much-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri as part of its released updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac software. The ChatGPT integration prompts when users ask it difficult questions, with Siri asking permission from the user to access the OpenAI service when it does. According to Apple, the feature has built-in privacy protections, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration will use OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. Moreover, while users won’t need an OpenAI account to use the ChatGPT features, they can pay for upgraded versions through Apple. Overall, AAPLranks 1ston our list of AI stock news and ratings dominating Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

      "content": "We recently compiled a list of the10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant’s investment strategy. AQR Capital Managementis a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness’ career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there’s ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR’s futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm’s performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. “We let the machine decide more,” Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Position size: $1.87 billion Activity: -1% Apple Inc (AAPL) AAPL stock was the third largest position in AQR’s portfolio at the end of the first quarter when we last talked about AQR’s AAPL investment. AAPL shares were trading at $171 at the time. Here is what we wrote: “ThoughApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)has been viewed as an underdog in the AI race, but recent advancements, including the introduction of the M4-powered iPad Pro with a powerful Neural Engine, indicate a resurgence. Following AI-focused announcements at WWDC, Apple’s market cap soared by over $215 billion, reaching a record high. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo emphasizes Apple’s competitive edge in on-device AI capabilities whereas Gene Munster suggests Apple is a better long-term investment than Nvidia due to its AI potential. Apple’s current valuation at 26 times its 2025 EPS estimate aligns reasonably with its projected sales growth, indicating its alignment with its growth prospects.” AAPL stock returned more than 40% since the end of first quarter. AQR took some money off the table, but its AAPL position still increased from $1.44 billion to $1.87 billion. Overall, AQR owns 0.05% of AAPL’s outstanding shares. Overall AAPLranks 2ndon our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant’s investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

      "content": "AQR Capital Managementis a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness’ career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there’s ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR’s futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm’s performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. “We let the machine decide more,” Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. Even though the billionaire quant investor reduced his fund’s position by 6%, AQR still owns around 0.13% of JNJ’s outstanding shares. Relatively this is the second most concentrated position among AQR’s top 10 holdings. This implies that AQR believes JNJ is deeply undervalued despite the fact that JNJ stock has underperformed the market by a large margin over the last 5 years. Revenue growth for the next year is projected to be at 13% and 15.10% annually over the next five years, trailing industry leaders like NVDA. Well, Cliff Asness’ computers decided during the third quarter that the stock offered decent upside as AVGO shares dipped below the $140 level at one point. Currently AVGO shares trade at $179, so Asness might be trimming his AVGO position one more time. We will find out in the middle of February. You can read why bullish investors think AVGO stock is stillundervalued at $180 here. This bullish stance is supported by expected growth in the advertising sector and accelerated U.S. In Q1 2024, 222 hedge funds held stakes in Alphabet, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest at $6.9 billion. Overall AQR owns only 0.03% of GOOGL’s outstanding shares. AQR also had $465 million invested in GOOG stock at the end of the third quarter, so overall AQR’s Alphabet exposure is more than a billion dollars. First, the regulators are trying to break up the company. Second, start-up AI companies like OpenAI, Perplexity are trying to change how consumers search for information. That wasn’t the case with LLY stock back in 2021 and 2022 when two of its directors purchased modest amounts of LLY stock at prices ranging from $182 to $304. LLY shares currently trade at $800, so those were pretty profitable insider purchases. Who knew? Today, investors like AQR Capital are piling into the stock because they believe that LLY’s new generation of GLP-1 drugs will generate more revenue and profits for LLY shareholders and the stock has a lot of upside ahead. There is a lot of noise in the Diabetes-Obesity space as many companies are looking for opportunities to get into the market, which is expected to exceed $100 billion in revenues in 2030. GE Aerospace has an installed base of approximately 44,000 commercial and 26,000 military aircraft engines. Meta Platforms is further expanding on AI to optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems, driving engagement and advertising revenue. In Q1, Meta’s revenue surged 27% to $36.5 billion, with 97% of this revenue sourced from ads. Ads revenue is projected to grow by 17% in 2024. Reels, a platform showing strong engagement, increased its ad load to 20% in Q1, up from 16.2% the previous year. Despite Meta’s impressive Q1 results, the stock faced a decline after announcing a CapEx forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. It still has $855 million invested in the stock despite the 25% gain in META shares. Basically AQR has been trimming its position in META to keep the invested amount around $850 million level. It is now a multinational technology company that has diversified into cloud computing, online advertising, artificial intelligence, and streaming services. At the time AQR had $937 million invested in the stock. AMZN shares returned 25% since then, yet AQR position in AMZN stock slightly dipped below the $930 million level. Company-wide operating income surged to $15.3 billion, up from $4.8 billion a year earlier, while net income doubled to $10.4 billion ($0.98 per diluted share). Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company’s strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive.” At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn’t too bullish on the stock. Position size: $1.87 billion Activity: -1% Apple Inc (AAPL) AAPL stock was the third largest position in AQR’s portfolio at the end of the first quarter when we last talked about AQR’s AAPL investment. AAPL shares were trading at $171 at the time. Here is what we wrote: “ThoughApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)has been viewed as an underdog in the AI race, but recent advancements, including the introduction of the M4-powered iPad Pro with a powerful Neural Engine, indicate a resurgence. Following AI-focused announcements at WWDC, Apple’s market cap soared by over $215 billion, reaching a record high. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo emphasizes Apple’s competitive edge in on-device AI capabilities whereas Gene Munster suggests Apple is a better long-term investment than Nvidia due to its AI potential. Apple’s current valuation at 26 times its 2025 EPS estimate aligns reasonably with its projected sales growth, indicating its alignment with its growth prospects.” AAPL stock returned more than 40% since the end of first quarter. AQR took some money off the table, but its AAPL position still increased from $1.44 billion to $1.87 billion. Overall, AQR owns 0.05% of AAPL’s outstanding shares. AQR’s NVDA position increased by 30% since then. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

Gill has repeatedly sparked meme stock rallies by posting cryptic messages and images to X, where he has 1.6 million followers. The last frenzycame in early Septemberwhen he posted a photo that was taken by some as a sign that he had sold some of his sizable position in Chewy.

While they maintained a buy rating on the shares, they lifted their price target by $50 to $400, well above the Visible Alpha average around $280 and 12% above Wednesday's close. The target is among the highest tracked by Visible Alpha, matching another postedlast month by Wedbush. The company might look to raise money to fund some of those businesses, the analysts wrote.

      "content": "(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. U.S. e-commerce sales hit a record this year on the unofficial shopping holiday, and artificial intelligence has played a starring role. According toAdobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task. “The good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works”. “While we’re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.” ABloomberg Opinioncolumn by Dave Lee reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal “troubling trends”. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential “enshittification”, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT’s appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee noted. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has risen in prominence within the AI investment sphere after the debut of Apple Intelligence, its AI-powered personal intelligence system. On December 2, UBS kept a “Neutral” rating on Apple (AAPL) with a $236 price target. The firm performed a recent survey of over 7,500 smartphone users in the U.S., UK, China, Germany, and Japan, revealing that iPhone demand is soft considering the interest surrounding artificial intelligence “remains muted.” The firm further noted that the 12-month global iPhone purchase intent was unchanged in the U.S., and AI-related responses were unchanged as well. Pricing remained the top concern among 51% of participants. Despite the muted demand for iPhones and weak interest in GenAI applications, the firm slightly raised its 2024 and 2025 global ‘smartphone’ sell-in estimates from 1.20B and 1.22B units to 1.21B and 1.24B respectively. Overall AAPLranks 1ston our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images U.S. stocks lost ground fora second consecutive sessionon Tuesday as the end-of-year rally hit resistance ahead of inflation data due tomorrow. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, whichclosed at record highslast Friday, also shed 0.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reportedsales jumped 34%in November as AI demand remained strong. Its shares, however, slid more than 3% alongside other chip stocks like Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU). Treasury yields continued to rise after ticking higher yesterday. The 10-year yield, which is sensitive to investors' interest rate expectations, climbed to 4.23%. Investors are awaiting akey consumer inflation report, scheduled to be released tomorrow, that will be one of the last pieces of data Federal Reserve officials get before they make their final rate decision of the year on Dec. 18. They earlier hit $409.72, their highest level since Nov. 5, 2021, a day after they set an all-time intraday record of $414.50. Wall Street's average target is closer to $290, according to Visible Alpha data, with the new Morgan Stanley target among the highest the site tracks. TheElon Musk-led company's shares are up about 65% this year—but all of the gains havecome since Election Day. Trump has vowed toroll back vehicle emissions standardsand halt other government support for EVs. The company noted that as of October 31, Siebel and his related entities had beneficial ownership over around 87.8% of its Class B common stock and approximately 21.6% of outstanding Class A common stock. As of November 30, the company had about 3.5 million Class B shares and 125 million Class A shares. The Siebel news offset a strong second quarter performance. Revenue rose 29% to $94.3 million, also exceeding forecasts. The company got a lift from a new global alliance agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) signed in September, making C3.ai the preferred AI application provider on Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform. It will also create a Microsoft-scale go-to-market engine. C3.ai also boosted its full-year revenue estimate to $378 million to $398 million from the previous outlook of $370 million to $395 million. However, it expects a non-GAAP loss from operations of $105 to $135 versus the earlier prediction of $95 to $125. The stock has gained almost 45% this year. Still, the stock is down 60% this year. The company's currentmarket capitalizationis about $8 billion, but it was worth more than $100 billion nine years ago. Citi analysts said they’re “still not seeing meaningful upside to total cloud revenue” which grew 24% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, driving “muted estimate revisions.” The firm maintained a “neutral” rating but raised its price target to $194. Deutsche Bank holds a “buy” rating and $200 price target. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported November sales of 276.06 billionNew Taiwan dollars($8.48 billion). Still, the sales numbers were down 12% from October's figures. However, revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year to NT$2.62 trillion. Wei calling the demand for AI real in the third-quarter earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC slid as much as 3% Tuesday afternoon, falling alongside other chip stocks. Still, even with Tuesday's losses, shares have risen more than 85% so far this year. That’s an 18% discount even after the company's stock slid 3% to $63.09 intraday Tuesday. “We see decelerating advertising revenue combining [with] increased marketing investments for sluggish profit growth,” the analysts said. Analysts added the company is “a keyecommerce player, but has been unable to deliver sustainable progress towards a core marketplace turnaround.” Advertising growth dipped from 23% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 7% in the third quarter of 2024. That’s due in part to eBay’s reliance on offsite promoted advertisements as opposed to core-onsite advertising, since the former requires eBay to pay for ad placement, Jefferies said. The carrier also boosted its guidance. In addition, it raised estimated synergies from the Hawaiian Airlines deal to at least $500 million by 2027. The carrier reported that it had raised its current-quarter adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $0.40 to $0.50 from $0.20 to $0.40, primarily because of stronger revenue performance and lower non-operating expense. Alaska Air noted that October and November close-in bookings were strong, and November revenue was better than anticipated. More recently, the stock climbed to a new record high on Monday before staging a dramatic intraday reversal on above-averagevolume, closing lower for the day and forming a bearishdark cloud covercandlestick pattern in the process. The stockgappedbelow the wedge’s lower trendline on Tuesday, potentially opening the door for follow-through earnings-related selling. The first support level to watch sits around $177. This price point, currently situated just below the50-day moving average (MA), could provide support near the upper range of a narrowconsolidationperiod that formed on the chart throughout most of October. Selling below this level may see the shares fall to the $165 level, a level that could attract buying interest near thetroughof a minorpullbackthat took place in late September. A decisive breakdown below that price sets the stage for a potential retest of lower support around $145. Bargain hunters could look for buying opportunities in this region near the closely watched200-day MAand several peaks that emerged in June and July. S&P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq 100 futures were up about 0.1%. C3.ai.",

The company is seeking a temporary injunction from a federal appeals court to block the law, which would force app stores like those operated by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL, GOOGL), along with internet providers, to cease supporting TikTok unless ByteDance divests from the app. The legal battle has already seen TikTok and ByteDance appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which upheld the law. Now, they are preparing to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing for the right to continue operations while the highest court decides whether to review the case. Chandlee’s declaration underscores the economic stakes involved. He pointed out that nearly two million U.S. creators would face a collective loss of almost $300 million in earnings, while TikTok itself would see a significant reduction in its global advertising revenue. Additionally, the platform’s role in U.S. commerce is substantial, with over 7 million U.S. accounts using TikTok for business purposes. An economic impact report by Oxford Economics cited by Chandlee highlights that 69% of these businesses experienced sales growth through TikTok, with 39% stating that the platform is critical to their survival.

The law in question was enacted after Congress and President Joe Biden expressed concerns over ByteDance’s ties to the Chinese government. However, the appeals court rejected claims that the ban would infringe on First Amendment rights, deeming the law narrowly tailored to address national security issues.

It was last fetching $102,675, up about 5% on the day . By comparison, Apple (AAPL.O) alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.

Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,619. It was last fetching $102,675, up about 5% on the day BTC=. By comparison, Apple AAPL.O alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.

      "content": "The move comes after the ministry and domestic businesses voiced concern about the impact of deep discounting by Chinese online platforms, with the ministry saying it was also worried about potential sale of counterfeits. Last month Vietnam told Chinese online retailersSheinand Temu to register with the government by the deadline or face the blocking of internet domains and a halt in use of their apps. The ministry and Shein did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Temu has also stumbled in Indonesia, where regulators have asked Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to block it in app stores in the country, to protect small merchants. ADVERTISEMENT Last week, Vietnam’s parliament approved legal changes to require payment of value-added tax (VAT) by local operators of foreign e-commerce platforms and urged scrapping of a tax exemption for low-cost imported goods. At the time, the finance ministry said it had begun the process to scrap the tax break. The change spells a blow for the foreign-dominated e-commerce industry, which has benefited since 2010 from VAT exemption and rules freeing up duties on imports worth less than 1 million dong ($40). But despite investor panic over its prospects, Temu remains an e-commerce powerhouse — one that Western competitors must continue to watch.",

Note the following: In the early trade, money flows are positive inApple Inc(NASDAQ:AAPL),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Alphabet Inc Class C(NASDAQ:GOOG),Microsoft Corp(NASDAQ:MSFT),NVIDIA Corp(NASDAQ:NVDA), andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). In the early trade, money flows are positive inSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSE:SPY) andInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1(NASDAQ:QQQ). The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. © 2026 Benzinga.com.

Aswath Damodaran, finance professor at New York Univerisity’s Stern School of Business, told Bloomberg Television on Monday that he recommends buying any of the Magnificent Sevenstocks on dips. What To Know:Corrections will occur and I'd suggest that when that happens you find a way to add at least one, maybe two or three of these companies, because these are so much part of what drives the economy and the market, Damodaran said. TheRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF(NASDAQ:MAGS) offers equal-weight exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks and is up nearly 60% year-to-date. As a value investor, I have never seen cash machines as lucrative as these companies are, Damodaran said. And I don't see the cash machine slowing down. Apple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) continue jockeying for the top position as the largest company in terms of market capitalization.
