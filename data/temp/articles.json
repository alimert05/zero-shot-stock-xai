An array of pharmaceutical pills with the company’s logo on the bottle. 5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.43 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106 Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a prominent global pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in the healthcare sector, particularly recognized for its range of treatments for diabetes and obesity. The company has been making waves with its breakthrough medications, such as Mounjaro, a diabetes treatment, and Zepbound, a companion drug for chronic weight management. In the third quarter, Mounjaro contributed 27.3% of total revenue, showing a 121% growth from the previous year, while Zepbound accounted for over 11% of the revenue. This growing demand for these treatments has positioned Eli Lilly well in the market, especially with the recent FDA approval of Zepbound for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder. This approval is particularly noteworthy as it marks Zepbound as the first drug authorized to directly treat patients suffering from this condition. Additionally, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) announced a substantial $4.5 billion investment in October for the construction of the Lilly Medicine Foundry in Lebanon, Indiana, scheduled to open in 2027. This facility will focus on research and development as well as production for clinical trials, further reinforcing Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) commitment to advancing healthcare solutions. Overall, LLYranks 3rdon our list of best low volatility stocks to buy right now.
