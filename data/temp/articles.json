      "content": "December 24, 2024Ari Haruni Apple‘s(AAPL)stock has recently soared to new all-time highs/<PRICE>, inching closer to a<PRICE> trillionmarket capitalization, driven largely by the optimism surrounding AI’s potential to spark a significant upgrade cycle for the iPhone. Forte attributes the recent run-up in Apple’s stock to an AI-fueled rally, with expectations high that AI enhancements will lead to a major iPhone upgrade cycle. Currently trading well above 30 times its price-to-earnings (<PE>) ratio, Apple’s <MARKET_CAP> is at or above its peers who are also benefiting from the AI surge. Forte points out that even with an anticipated upgrade cycle, Apple’s earnings per share (EPS) growth over the next couple of years looks to be in the mid to high single digits, suggesting that the stock might be overpriced relative to its growth prospects. He also notes the ongoing education of consumers by companies like Google (GOOG) and Apple about the benefits of AI in smartphones, indicating that the demand for AI-driven upgrades is not yet a certainty. Forte has maintained his ‘hold’ rating since Apple’s developers conference where they unveiled their AI strategy, observing the market’s reaction but waiting for clear evidence of how AI will translate into earnings growth for Apple. Given Apple’s size, he suggests that while such a product might add marginal earnings, perhaps around 10 cents per share, it wouldn’t significantly move the needle, especially when the iPhone still constitutes about half of Apple’s revenue. In essence, while the market celebrates Apple’s AI advancements and the potential for an upgrade cycle, Forte’s analysis suggests a more measured approach, focusing on <MARKET_CAP>, the timing and impact of AI integration, and the comparative scale of new product entries against Apple’s massive revenue base.",

      "content": "December 27, 2024Ron Haruni On CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime,”Dan Ives,Wedbush‘s global head of technology research, shared his insights on Apple’s recent performance and its potential path to a <PRICE> trillion <MARKET_CAP>, primarily driven by an anticipated AI upgrade cycle. Ives recentlyraisedhis <PRICE_TARGET> for Apple (AAPL) to a Street-High of <PRICE> from <PRICE>, maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares, attributing his optimism to recent channel checks indicating a robust holiday season, projecting Apple to sell 240 million iPhones this year. Despite Apple’s stock trading at high multiples compared to its earnings, Ives dismissed concerns about overvaluation. He argued that Apple’s services business alone could justify a <PRICE> trillion <MARKET_CAP>, and with AI integration, revenue could increase significantly, potentially adding <PRICE> to <PRICE> billion annually. This, combined with what he believes will be an underestimated growth in iPhone sales, could push Apple’s <MARKET_CAP> far beyond current expectations. He emphasized thatApple Intelligence, part of the iOS 18.2 update, would catalyze this cycle, with hundreds of new AI-driven apps expected to enhance the iPhone ecosystem. He believes that the integration of AI will not only drive iPhone upgrades but also extend across Apple’s entire product line, including iPads and Macs, marking the beginning of a multi-year AI-driven upgrade super cycle. Ives concluded that the current <MARKET_CAP> of Apple, around <PRICE> trillion, does not reflect the potential growth from AI monetization.",

      "content": "December 9, 2024Ari Haruni Watch the latest video atfoxbusiness.com Keith Fitz-Gerald, Chief Investment Officer at the Fitz-Gerald Group, recently appeared on Fox Business’s “Varney & Co.” to discuss his outlook on two prominent tech stocks:Apple (AAPL)andPalantir (PLTR). He highlighted that potentially <PCT> of the world’s population might access AI through Apple devices by next year, potentially boosting Apple’s earnings growth by 20 to <PCT>. When questioned about whether this growth would directly translate into stock price increases, Fitz-Gerald affirmed the correlation between earnings and stock prices over long periods, suggesting that Apple’s current under-the-radar status mirrors past underestimations at the iPhone’s launch in 2007 and the expansion of services in 2014. Overall, Fitz-Gerald’s insights provide a bullish outlook on both Apple and Palantir, underpinned by expected technological adoption and operational efficiencies, while maintaining a cautious eye on external geopolitical and economic factors that could sway market directions.",

      "content": "December 10, 2024Ari Haruni Apple‘s(AAPL)stock has been soaring to new heights, bolstered by the company’s evolution from a hardware-focused entity to a tech giant with a massive, engaged user base of over 1 billion unique users across 2.3 billion devices.Toni Sacconaghi, a senior research analyst at Bernstein, discussed this transition on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box,’ emphasizing how Apple is now leveraging this installed base to bring artificial intelligence to the masses through its Apple Intelligence initiative and integration with large language models like ChatGPT. Sacconaghi pointed out that while the recent stock performance might not be solely due to the latest iOS 18.2 beta release, investors are optimistic about the trajectory of Apple’s AI integration. With Apple Intelligence expected to evolve, it’s seen as a key access point for consumers to engage with AI through their iPhones, Macs, or iPads. Despite some market uncertainties, such as questions about AI growth sustainability, tariffs, and antitrust issues with Google, Apple is viewed as a safe investment haven. He highlighted Apple’s adept management under CEO Tim Cook, who has maintained good relations with both China, crucial for Apple’s manufacturing and sales, and the incoming U.S. This diplomatic skill was showcased when Apple managed to avoid a proposed <PCT> tariff on smartphones during previous political talks. Regarding the integration of AI into Apple’s products, Sacconaghi noted that while the current features might not be game-changing, there’s a clear path forward for enhancement. Looking ahead to Apple’s fiscal 2026, he predicted a strong iPhone sales cycle driven by better AI capabilities, a new thinner form factor, and an older installed base ripe for upgrades.",
