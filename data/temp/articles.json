      "content": "We recently published a list of8 Best Low Volatility Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now.\nThe market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump’s policies take effect.\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed’s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed’s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn’t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn’t ruling out anything.\nOn Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed’s path forward.\nFor this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stocks screener to identify 30 companies with the largest market cap and a 5-year beta (monthly) between 0.2 and 0.8. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The 8 best low-risk stocks to buy are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn array of pharmaceutical pills with the company’s logo on the bottle.\n5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.43\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a prominent global pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in the healthcare sector, particularly recognized for its range of treatments for diabetes and obesity. The company has been making waves with its breakthrough medications, such as Mounjaro, a diabetes treatment, and Zepbound, a companion drug for chronic weight management. Both of these products have become significant contributors to the company’s revenue.\nIn the third quarter, Mounjaro contributed 27.3% of total revenue, showing a 121% growth from the previous year, while Zepbound accounted for over 11% of the revenue. This growing demand for these treatments has positioned Eli Lilly well in the market, especially with the recent FDA approval of Zepbound for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder.\nThis approval is particularly noteworthy as it marks Zepbound as the first drug authorized to directly treat patients suffering from this condition. Additionally, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) announced a substantial $4.5 billion investment in October for the construction of the Lilly Medicine Foundry in Lebanon, Indiana, scheduled to open in 2027. This facility will focus on research and development as well as production for clinical trials, further reinforcing Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) commitment to advancing healthcare solutions.\nOverall, LLYranks 3rdon our list of best low volatility stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Nowand30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

      "content": "The company states: “Eli Lilly (LLY) announced that the National Medical Products Administration in China has approved Kisunla, an Alzheimer’s treatment for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease, which includes people with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, as well as people with the mild dementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease who have confirmed amyloid pathology.  China is the fourth major market in which Kisunla has been approved for use, following approvals in the United States, Japan and Great Britain. In China, it is estimated that nearly 6% of people over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, with nearly 11% over the age of 65 expected to be living with Alzheimer’s disease by 2050.  Among the two groups analyzed, participants treated with Kisunla had up to a 39% lower risk of progressing to the next clinical stage of disease than those taking placebo.  Among the overall population of participants, Kisunla reduced amyloid plaques on average by 61% at 6 months, 80% at 12 months, and 84% at 18 months compared to the start of the study.  One of the treatment goals of the study was to remove amyloid plaques to minimal levels consistent with a visually negative scan using amyloid positron emission tomography. If participants were confirmed to have reached these levels, they were able to complete treatment with Kisunla and switch to placebo for the remainder of the study. In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, 66% of patients achieved plaque clearance  at one year.”\nPublished first onTheFly– the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.Try Now>>\nSee Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>\nRead More on LLY:\nCopyright © 2025Insider Inc andfinanzen.netGmbH (Imprint).
