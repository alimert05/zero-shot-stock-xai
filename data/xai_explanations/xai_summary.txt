  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 45.3% score share based on 128 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "Apple's AI challenges in 2026" with a NEGATIVE sentiment, accounting for 1.4% of total weight.
The label margin is moderate (0.129), but reliability is LOW due to a moderate decision margin; source concentration (yahoo has 78% of articles).

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  Verdict     : POSITIVE
  Model support : 45.3%  (share of model weight, not a probability)

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict; most articles come from the same source, reducing editorial independence. Mitigation: articles are de-duplicated by title; weighting is content-based (not source-based) so syndicated copies receive lower combined weight if they are older or off-horizon.

============================================================
  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 128 news articles analysed for apple over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 63 carried positive sentiment,
  46 carried negative sentiment, and 19 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 45.3% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  12.9 percentage points: 72 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 56 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single
  most influential article was "Apple's AI challenges in
  2026" (negative sentiment, contributing 1.4% of total
  weight). Articles were weighted by recency and
  prediction-horizon relevance — the average article was
  14.7 days old, with most classified as short-term
  horizon. At the word level, the strongest signals in the
  top gap-driving article included: Up, Win, China,
  mobile, iPhone. The prediction is sensitive: removing as
  few as 12 of 128 articles would change the verdict. The
  prediction carries LOW reliability and should not be
  used in isolation. The positive and negative scores are
  very close — a small shift in news could change the
  verdict; most articles come from the same source,
  reducing editorial independence. mitigation: articles
  are de-duplicated by title; weighting is content-based
  (not source-based) so syndicated copies receive lower
  combined weight if they are older or off-horizon.

  WHY POSITIVE INSTEAD OF NEGATIVE?
  Contrastive explanation — what tipped the balance
------------------------------------------------------------
  Score gap : POSITIVE 45.3%  vs  NEGATIVE 32.4%  (gap = 12.9 percentage points)

  Article split:
     72 articles push toward POSITIVE  (total push: +36.1 pp)
     56 articles push toward NEGATIVE  (total push: -23.2 pp)

  Third class: NEUTRAL at 22.4% — absorbing probability mass roughly equally from both sides.

  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.
