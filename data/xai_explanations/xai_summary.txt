  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a NEGATIVE label with a 48.0% score share based on 106 articles over 7 days.
The top article is "Stock Market Week: Nvidia Earnings, Apple And Strategy Events" with a positive sentiment.
The label margin is narrow (0.076), but reliability is LOW due to a narrow decision margin; news lookback (13 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (14 days).

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 7-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  Score chart  (each █ ≈ 2.5%):

    positive :  40.4%  ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    negative :  48.0%  ███████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ◄ PREDICTED
     neutral :  11.6%  █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

  Verdict     : NEGATIVE
  Model support : 48.0%  (share of model weight, not a probability)

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict; news lookback (13 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (14 days, √W scaling), signal may be incomplete.

============================================================
  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 106 news articles analysed for Apple over a 7-day
  forecast horizon, 48 carried positive sentiment, 58
  carried negative sentiment, and 0 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a NEGATIVE label with 48.0% model support.
  The model chose NEGATIVE over POSITIVE by a margin of
  7.6 percentage points: 58 articles pushed toward
  NEGATIVE while 48 pushed toward POSITIVE. The single
  most influential article was "Stock Market Week: Nvidia
  Earnings, Apple And Strategy Events" (positive
  sentiment, contributing 1.8% of total weight). Articles
  were weighted by recency and prediction-horizon
  relevance — the average article was 6.69 days old, with
  most classified as short-term horizon. At the word
  level, the strongest signals in the top gap-driving
  article included: Falls, Concerns, Unease, Stock,
  Wedbush. The prediction is sensitive: removing as few as
  6 of 106 articles would change the verdict. The
  prediction carries LOW reliability and should not be
  used in isolation. The positive and negative scores are
  very close — a small shift in news could change the
  verdict; news lookback (13 days) is shorter than the
  intended backward window (14 days, √w scaling), signal
  may be incomplete.

  Rating rule : HIGH if 0 concerns, MEDIUM if 1, LOW if ≥2.

    [✓] Evidence volume        Sufficient article count.
    [✓] Weight spread          Weight is well-distributed across articles.

    [✓] Score confidence       Above reliability threshold (0.480 ≥ 0.45).
    [✓] Source diversity       6 sources (5 editorial + 1 aggregators), top editorial share 46%. (67% via aggregators like Yahoo/Finnhub — these collect from many editorial sources)
    [✓] Timing validity        Articles span 0-12 days old (ET market-close aligned); oldest exceeds the 7-day window and is down-weighted by recency.
    [⚠] Horizon coverage       News lookback is 13 days but the intended backward window was 14 days (√W scaling, W=7), signal may be incomplete.

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 6.69 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.6436  (1.0 = today, lower = older)
  Average horizon weight   : 0.5189  (1.0 = ideal timing, lower = off-horizon)

  WHICH WORDS DROVE THE PREDICTION
  Words inside each article that pushed the model toward or away from the verdict
------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
