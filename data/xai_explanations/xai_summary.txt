  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 64.6% score share based on 21 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "Apple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play" with a NEGATIVE sentiment.
The label margin is clear (0.404), but reliability is LOW due to source concentration and news lookback being shorter than the intended backward window.

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  Verdict     : POSITIVE
  Model support : 64.6%  (share of model weight, not a probability)

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: most articles come from the same editorial source, reducing editorial independence. Note: aggregators (Yahoo, Finnhub) are excluded from this check because they collect from many independent editorial desks. Mitigation: articles are de-duplicated across all domains by title (keeping the oldest copy — the first to break the news); weighting is content-based (not source-based); news lookback (27 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (28 days, √W scaling), signal may be incomplete.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 21 news articles analysed for Apple Inc. over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 17 carried positive sentiment,
  4 carried negative sentiment, and 0 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 64.6% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  40.4 percentage points: 17 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 4 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single most
  influential article was "Apple is an Analyst Favorite,
  But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best
  Play" (negative sentiment, contributing 8.6% of total
  weight). Articles were weighted by recency and
  prediction-horizon relevance — the average article was
  13.86 days old, with most classified as short-term
  horizon. At the word level, the strongest signals in the
  top gap-driving article included: Confident, Overweight,
  iPhone, reiterated, Reaches. The prediction is
  sensitive: removing as few as 9 of 21 articles would
  change the verdict. The prediction carries LOW
  reliability and should not be used in isolation. Most
  articles come from the same editorial source, reducing
  editorial independence. note: aggregators (yahoo,
  finnhub) are excluded from this check because they
  collect from many independent editorial desks.
  mitigation: articles are de-duplicated across all
  domains by title (keeping the oldest copy — the first to
  break the news); weighting is content-based (not source-
  based); news lookback (27 days) is shorter than the
  intended backward window (28 days, √w scaling), signal
  may be incomplete.

  PREDICTION RELIABILITY
  How much to trust this prediction
------------------------------------------------------------
  Overall : [✗] LOW  (2 concern(s) found)
  Rating rule : HIGH if 0 concerns, MEDIUM if 1, LOW if ≥2.
  Note : Reliability is LOW due to data-quality risks (source concentration,
         timing alignment, short lookback), not because the model is
         uncertain about the label.

    [✓] Evidence volume        Sufficient article count.
    [✓] Weight spread          Weight is well-distributed across articles.
    [✓] Decision confidence    Clear margin between top two labels (0.404).
    [✓] Score confidence       Above reliability threshold (0.646 ≥ 0.45).
    [⚠] Source diversity       Source diversity concern: only 0 unique editorial source(s).
    [✓] Timing validity        Articles are 2-28 days old (ET market-close aligned), down-weighted by the recency function where applicable.
    [⚠] Horizon coverage       News lookback is 27 days but the intended backward window was 28 days (√W scaling, W=31), signal may be incomplete.

  Thresholds used  : reliability confidence ≥ 0.45

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 13.86 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.6737  (1.0 = today, lower = older)
  Average horizon weight   : 0.3631  (1.0 = ideal timing, lower = off-horizon)

  WHICH WORDS DROVE THE PREDICTION
  Words inside each article that pushed the model toward or away from the verdict
------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
