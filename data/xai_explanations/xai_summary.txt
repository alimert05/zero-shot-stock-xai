  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a NEGATIVE label with a 35.6% score share based on 66 articles.
The top article is "These were the highlights from Apple's earnings" with a positive sentiment, accounting for 2.2% of the total weight.
The label margin is narrow (0.025), but reliability is LOW due to a narrow decision margin; confidence is below threshold; source concentration (yahoo has 79% of articles); news lookback (5 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (7 days).

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 1-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

    negative :  35.6%  ██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ◄ PREDICTED
     neutral :  31.4%  █████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

  Verdict     : NEGATIVE
  Model support : 35.6%  (share of model weight, not a probability)

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict; overall confidence is below the recommended threshold; most articles come from the same source, reducing editorial independence. Mitigation: articles are de-duplicated by title; weighting is content-based (not source-based) so syndicated copies receive lower combined weight if they are older or off-horizon; news lookback (5 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (7 days, √W scaling), signal may be incomplete.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 66 news articles analysed for Apple over a 1-day
  forecast horizon, 23 carried positive sentiment, 25
  carried negative sentiment, and 18 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a NEGATIVE label with 35.6% model support.
  The model chose NEGATIVE over POSITIVE by a margin of
  2.5 percentage points: 34 articles pushed toward
  NEGATIVE while 32 pushed toward POSITIVE. The single
  most influential article was "These were the highlights
  from Apple's earnings" (positive sentiment, contributing
  2.2% of total weight). Articles were weighted by recency
  and prediction-horizon relevance — the average article
  was 2.08 days old, with most classified as short-term
  horizon. At the word level, the strongest signals in the
  top gap-driving article included: Falling, earnings,
  Tree, risking, headwinds. The prediction is sensitive:
  removing as few as 2 of 66 articles would change the
  verdict. The prediction carries LOW reliability and
  should not be used in isolation. The positive and
  negative scores are very close — a small shift in news
  could change the verdict; overall confidence is below
  the recommended threshold; most articles come from the
  same source, reducing editorial independence.
  mitigation: articles are de-duplicated by title;
  weighting is content-based (not source-based) so
  syndicated copies receive lower combined weight if they
  are older or off-horizon; news lookback (5 days) is
  shorter than the intended backward window (7 days, √w
  scaling), signal may be incomplete.

  WHICH WORDS DROVE THE PREDICTION
  Words inside each article that pushed the model toward or away from the verdict
------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
