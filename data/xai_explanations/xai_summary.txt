  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 58.7% score share based on 99 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "Amazon backs Flowers Foods at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status" with a NEGATIVE sentiment, accounting for 1.9% of the total weight.
The label margin is clear (0.285), but reliability is HIGH due to no concerns and a narrow margin.

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 99 news articles analysed for amazon over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 67 carried positive sentiment,
  31 carried negative sentiment, and 1 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 58.7% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  28.5 percentage points: 67 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 32 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single
  most influential article was "Amazon backs Flowers Foods
  at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status" (negative
  sentiment, contributing 1.9% of total weight). Articles
  were weighted by recency and prediction-horizon
  relevance — the average article was 14.85 days old, with
  most classified as short-term horizon. At the word
  level, the strongest signals in the top gap-driving
  article included: Buy, Cramer, Stock, After, give. The
  prediction is sensitive: removing as few as 24 of 99
  articles would change the verdict. The prediction
  carries HIGH reliability and can be used with
  confidence.

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 14.85 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.6581  (1.0 = today, lower = older)

------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
