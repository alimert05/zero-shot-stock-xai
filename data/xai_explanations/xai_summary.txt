  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 47.2% score share based on 150 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "Apple's AI challenges in 2026" with a NEGATIVE sentiment, accounting for 1.3% of total weight.
The label margin is narrow (0.071), but reliability is MEDIUM due to a narrow decision margin and source concentration.

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has MEDIUM reliability — treat it as indicative, not definitive. Specifically: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 150 news articles analysed for apple over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 80 carried positive sentiment,
  67 carried negative sentiment, and 3 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 47.2% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  7.1 percentage points: 82 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 68 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single
  most influential article was "Apple's AI challenges in
  2026" (negative sentiment, contributing 1.3% of total
  weight). Articles were weighted by recency and
  prediction-horizon relevance — the average article was
  15.83 days old, with most classified as short-term
  horizon. At the word level, the strongest signals in the
  top gap-driving article included: Up, Stock, Win, rose,
  After. The prediction is sensitive: removing as few as 7
  of 150 articles would change the verdict. The prediction
  carries MEDIUM reliability. The positive and negative
  scores are very close — a small shift in news could
  change the verdict.

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 15.83 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.6388  (1.0 = today, lower = older)
  Average horizon weight   : 0.3512  (1.0 = ideal timing, lower = off-horizon)

  WHICH WORDS DROVE THE PREDICTION
  Words inside each article that pushed the model toward or away from the verdict
------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
