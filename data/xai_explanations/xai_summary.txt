  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 47.5% score share based on 256 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "TSMC Shares Rise on AI Demand and Next-Gen Chip Launch" with a positive sentiment.
The label margin is narrow (0.071), but reliability is MEDIUM due to a narrow decision margin and source concentration.

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has MEDIUM reliability — treat it as indicative, not definitive. Specifically: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict.

============================================================
  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 256 news articles analysed for Apple over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 134 carried positive sentiment,
  117 carried negative sentiment, and 5 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 47.5% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  7.1 percentage points: 142 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 114 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single
  most influential article was "TSMC Shares Rise on AI
  Demand and Next-Gen Chip Launch" (positive sentiment,
  contributing 0.7% of total weight). Articles were
  weighted by recency and prediction-horizon relevance —
  the average article was 15.42 days old, with most
  classified as short-term horizon. At the word level, the
  strongest signals in the top gap-driving article
  included: Up, Stock, Win, iPhone, China. The prediction
  is sensitive: removing as few as 12 of 256 articles
  would change the verdict. The prediction carries MEDIUM
  reliability. The positive and negative scores are very
  close — a small shift in news could change the verdict.

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 15.42 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.6455  (1.0 = today, lower = older)
  Average horizon weight   : 0.37  (1.0 = ideal timing, lower = off-horizon)

  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.
