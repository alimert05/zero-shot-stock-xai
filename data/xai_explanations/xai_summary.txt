  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a NEGATIVE label with a 41.1% score share based on 128 articles over 31 days.
The top article is "Apple's AI challenges in 2026" with a NEGATIVE sentiment, accounting for 1.4% of the total weight.
The label margin is narrow (0.054), but reliability is LOW due to a narrow decision margin; confidence is below threshold; source concentration (yahoo has 78% of articles).

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 31-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

  WHY NEGATIVE INSTEAD OF POSITIVE?
  Contrastive explanation — what tipped the balance
------------------------------------------------------------

  PREDICTION RELIABILITY
  How much to trust this prediction
------------------------------------------------------------
  Overall : [✗] LOW  (3 concern(s) found)
  Rating rule : HIGH if 0 concerns, MEDIUM if 1, LOW if ≥2.

    [✓] Evidence volume        Sufficient article count.
    [✓] Weight spread          Weight is well-distributed across articles.
    [⚠] Decision confidence    Narrow margin between negative (0.411) and positive (0.358): margin=0.054.
    [⚠] Score confidence       Below reliability threshold (0.411 < 0.45).
    [⚠] Source diversity       Source diversity concern: top domain 'yahoo' has 78% of articles.
    [✓] Timing validity        Articles are 1-28 days old (ET market-close aligned), down-weighted by the recency function where applicable.
    [✓] Horizon coverage       News lookback (28 days) covers the intended 28-day backward window.

  Thresholds used  : reliability confidence ≥ 0.45

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: the positive and negative scores are very close — a small shift in news could change the verdict; overall confidence is below the recommended threshold; most articles come from the same source, reducing editorial independence. Mitigation: articles are de-duplicated by title; weighting is content-based (not source-based) so syndicated copies receive lower combined weight if they are older or off-horizon.

------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 128 news articles analysed for apple over a
  31-day forecast horizon, 48 carried positive sentiment,
  54 carried negative sentiment, and 26 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a NEGATIVE label with 41.1% model support.
  The model chose NEGATIVE over POSITIVE by a margin of
  5.4 percentage points: 66 articles pushed toward
  NEGATIVE while 62 pushed toward POSITIVE. The single
  most influential article was "Apple's AI challenges in
  2026" (negative sentiment, contributing 1.4% of total
  weight). Articles were weighted by recency and
  prediction-horizon relevance — the average article was
  14.7 days old, with most classified as short-term
  horizon. At the word level, the strongest signals in the
  top gap-driving article included: Fails, Cringe,
  execution, product, Letdown. The prediction is
  sensitive: removing as few as 5 of 128 articles would
  change the verdict. The prediction carries LOW
  reliability and should not be used in isolation. The
  positive and negative scores are very close — a small
  shift in news could change the verdict; overall
  confidence is below the recommended threshold; most
  articles come from the same source, reducing editorial
  independence. mitigation: articles are de-duplicated by
  title; weighting is content-based (not source-based) so
  syndicated copies receive lower combined weight if they
  are older or off-horizon.
