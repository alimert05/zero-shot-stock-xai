  PART 1 — SUMMARY & KEY FINDINGS
  Plain-English explanation of what the model decided and why
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SUMMARY
  What the model decided and why — in plain English
------------------------------------------------------------

  The model predicted a POSITIVE label with a 51.9% score share based on 8 articles over 7 days.
The top article is "As Apple Tests AI Devices, Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?" with a positive sentiment of 23.2% of the total weight.
The label margin is moderate (0.157), but reliability is LOW due to source concentration and news lookback being shorter than the intended backward window.

  PREDICTION RESULT
  Sentiment scores across all analysed articles
------------------------------------------------------------
  Ground truth : close-to-close return over 7-day forecast horizon, neutral band +/-0.3%.
  Disclaimer   : Model support measures how much weight the model
                  assigns to the winning label relative to alternatives.
                  It is NOT a calibrated probability of future return
                  and should not be read as '41% chance the price drops'.

     neutral :  12.0%  █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

  Verdict     : POSITIVE
  Model support : 51.9%  (share of model weight, not a probability)

  RECOMMENDATION
  What you should do with this result
------------------------------------------------------------
  This prediction has LOW reliability and should NOT be used alone for decisions. Reasons: most articles come from the same editorial source, reducing editorial independence. Note: aggregators (Yahoo, Finnhub) are excluded from this check because they collect from many independent editorial desks. Mitigation: articles are de-duplicated across all domains by title (keeping the oldest copy — the first to break the news); weighting is content-based (not source-based); news lookback (11 days) is shorter than the intended backward window (14 days, √W scaling), signal may be incomplete.

  FINAL PLAIN-ENGLISH OVERVIEW
  A complete, readable summary of the entire analysis for a general reader
============================================================

  Out of 8 news articles analysed for Apple Inc. over a
  7-day forecast horizon, 6 carried positive sentiment, 2
  carried negative sentiment, and 0 were neutral. The
  model produced a weighted aggregation of these scores
  and predicted a POSITIVE label with 51.9% model support.
  The model chose POSITIVE over NEGATIVE by a margin of
  15.7 percentage points: 6 articles pushed toward
  POSITIVE while 2 pushed toward NEGATIVE. The single most
  influential article was "As Apple Tests AI Devices,
  Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?" (positive sentiment,
  contributing 23.2% of total weight). Articles were
  weighted by recency and prediction-horizon relevance —
  the average article was 8.38 days old, with most
  classified as short-term horizon. At the word level, the
  strongest signals in the top gap-driving article
  included: Buy, grab, Stock, growth, perfect. The
  prediction is sensitive: removing as few as 1 of 8
  articles would change the verdict. The prediction
  carries LOW reliability and should not be used in
  isolation. Most articles come from the same editorial
  source, reducing editorial independence. note:
  aggregators (yahoo, finnhub) are excluded from this
  check because they collect from many independent
  editorial desks. mitigation: articles are de-duplicated
  across all domains by title (keeping the oldest copy —
  the first to break the news); weighting is content-based
  (not source-based); news lookback (11 days) is shorter
  than the intended backward window (14 days, √w scaling),
  signal may be incomplete.

  WHY POSITIVE INSTEAD OF NEGATIVE?
  Contrastive explanation — what tipped the balance
------------------------------------------------------------
  Score gap : POSITIVE 51.9%  vs  NEGATIVE 36.2%  (gap = 15.7 percentage points)

  Article split:
      6 articles push toward POSITIVE  (total push: +43.3 pp)
      2 articles push toward NEGATIVE  (total push: -27.6 pp)

  Third class: NEUTRAL at 12.0% — drawing more mass from NEGATIVE than POSITIVE, indirectly helping POSITIVE.

  PREDICTION RELIABILITY
  How much to trust this prediction
------------------------------------------------------------
  Overall : [✗] LOW  (2 concern(s) found)
  Rating rule : HIGH if 0 concerns, MEDIUM if 1, LOW if ≥2.
  Note : Reliability is LOW due to data-quality risks (source concentration,
         timing alignment, short lookback), not because the model is
         uncertain about the label.

    [✓] Evidence volume        Sufficient article count.
    [✓] Weight spread          Weight is well-distributed across articles.
    [✓] Decision confidence    Clear margin between top two labels (0.157).
    [✓] Score confidence       Above reliability threshold (0.519 ≥ 0.45).
    [⚠] Source diversity       Source diversity concern: only 0 unique editorial source(s).
    [✓] Timing validity        Articles span 2-12 days old (ET market-close aligned); oldest exceeds the 7-day window and is down-weighted by recency.
    [⚠] Horizon coverage       News lookback is 11 days but the intended backward window was 14 days (√W scaling, W=7), signal may be incomplete.

  Thresholds used  : reliability confidence ≥ 0.45

  HOW ARTICLES WERE WEIGHTED
  More recent and near-horizon articles receive higher weight
------------------------------------------------------------
  De-duplication  : Articles are de-duplicated across all sources
                    by headline. When the same headline appears on
                    multiple domains (e.g. Yahoo and Benzinga), only
                    the oldest copy is kept — the first to break the
                    news is what the market reacted to. If two copies
                    share the same timestamp, the one with more content
                    is preferred.

  Average article age      : 8.38 days old
  Average recency weight   : 0.5686  (1.0 = today, lower = older)
  Average horizon weight   : 0.456  (1.0 = ideal timing, lower = off-horizon)

  IMPORTANT: these tokens explain why the *sentiment model* chose its
  label — they do NOT indicate why a stock price would move. LIME
  (Ribeiro et al., 2016) perturbs the input text and measures which
  words most change the model's output distribution. The results are
  model-internal attributions, not causal drivers of market returns.

  Company name, ticker, and common stopwords are filtered so only
  sentiment-bearing words remain. Full token weights are in the
